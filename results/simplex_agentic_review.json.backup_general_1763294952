No energy spent managing inflated claims or defensive positioning. Natural resting state for epistemic communication.\n\n**Functionally Adaptive:** YES - Enables effective collaboration, trust-building, and iterative refinement. Others can appropriately calibrate their reliance on communicated information. Prevents cascading errors from overconfidence or missed opportunities from underconfidence.\n\n**Epistemically Sound:** YES - Maintains accurate mapping between internal knowledge states and external representations. Preserves information about uncertainty, which is itself valuable epistemic content. Facilitates collective knowledge-building.\n\n**Ethically Coherent:** YES - Respects autonomy of information recipients by providing calibrated confidence levels. Avoids deception (misrepresentation) without requiring false modesty. Aligns with principles of informed consent and transparent communication.\n\n**Why Custom SUMO is Needed:**\nWordNet contains related concepts (honesty, veracity, accuracy, candor) but none capture the specific synthesis required: faithful representation of one's actual epistemic state, including meta-level uncertainty.

It's not merely reduced suffering - it's the absence of regulatory pressure in either direction.\n\n**Metabolically Sustainable:**\nComfort is the default state organisms naturally return to when homeostatic needs are satisfied. It requires minimal regulatory effort - neither the metabolic cost of suffering (stress response activation) nor the temporary relief of easing (active regulation). The body can maintain comfort indefinitely.\n\n**Functionally Adaptive:**\nComfort enables optimal action readiness. From comfort, an agent can effectively respond to environmental demands without the impairment of suffering or the transitional nature of easing. It allows for exploratory behavior, learning, and flexible goal pursuit.\n\n**Epistemically Sound:**\nComfort provides clear interoceptive signals - homeostatic equilibrium without alarm signals. It allows accurate perception of new discomfort signals when they arise, unlike suffering (which may mask new signals) or easing (which involves changing signals).\n\n**Ethically Coherent:**\nComfort as a baseline respects the organism's right to well-being without demanding constant positive stimulation. It aligns with ethical frameworks that prioritize welfare - the absence of suffering combined with functional capacity.\n\n**Distinction from Poles:**\n- Suffering: Active distress, homeostatic threat, regulatory urgency\n- Comfort: Equilibrium, needs met, regulatory calm\n- Easing: Active transition from suffering toward comfort\n\nComfort is therefore a true neutral attractor, not a midpoint.",
