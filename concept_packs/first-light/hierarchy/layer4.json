The only extant member of the genus\nAcinonyx, the cheetah was first described by Johann Christian Daniel von\nSchreber in 1775. The cheetah is characterised by a slender body, deep chest,\nspotted coat, a small rounded head, black tear-like streaks on the face, long\nthin legs and a long spotted tail. Its lightly built, slender form is in sharp\ncontrast with the robust build of the big cats, making it more similar to the\ncougar. The cheetah reaches nearly 70 to 90 cm (28 to 35 in) at the shoulder,\nand weighs 21\u201372 kg (46\u2013159 lb). Though taller than the leopard, it is notably\nsmaller than the lion. Basically yellowish tan or rufous to greyish white, the\ncoat is uniformly covered with nearly 2,000 solid black spots. [Wikipedia]",

      "definition": "Gaslighting is a\ncolloquialism that is loosely defined as making someone question their\nreality. The term is also used informally to describe someone (a\n'gaslighter') who persistently puts forth a false narrative which\nleads another person (or a group of people) to doubt their own\nperceptions to the extent that they become disoriented and distressed.\nThis dynamic is generally only possible when the audience is\nvulnerable such as in unequal power relationships or when the audience\nis fearful of the losses associated with challenging the false\nnarrative. Gaslighting is not necessarily malicious or intentional,\nalthough in some cases it is. [from Wikipedia]",

      "definition": "Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a group o\nbacteria that are genetically distinct from other strains of &%Staphylococcus aureus. MRSA is\nresponsible for several difficult-to-treat infections in humans. It caused more than 100,000 deaths\nattributable to antimicrobial resistance in 2019. MRSA is any strain of S. aureus that has developed\n(through natural selection) or acquired (through horizontal gene transfer) a multiple drug resistance\nto beta-lactam antibiotics.\nMRSA is common in &%HospitalBuildings, &%Prisons, and nursing homes, where people with open wounds, invasive devices\nsuch as catheters, and weakened immune systems are at greater risk of healthcare associated infection. MRSA\nbegan as a hospital-acquired infection but has become community-acquired, as well as &%Livestock -acquired. The\nterms HA-MRSA (healthcare-associated or hospital-acquired MRSA), CA-MRSA (community-associated MRSA), and\nLA-MRSA (livestock-associated MRSA) reflect this.[from Wikipedia]",

Corroded by halogens, cyandies, sulphur and alkalis.\n{Hydrogen} and {oxygen} react explosively in the presence of platinum.\nThere are six stable isotopes and three radioisotopes, the most stable\nbeing Pt-193 with a half-life of 60 years.  Platinum is used in jewelry,\nlaboratory equipment, electrical contacts, dentistry, and anti-pollution\ndevices in cars.  PtCl2(NH3)2 is used to treat some forms of cancer.\nPlatinum-{cobalt} alloys have magnetic properties.  It is also used in the\ndefinition of the Standard Hydrogen Electrode.  Discovered by Antonio de\nUlloa in South America in 1735.  The name comes from the Spanish word\nplatina which means silver.  Platinum metal is generally not a health\nconcern due to its unreactivity, however platinum compounds should be\nconsidered highly toxic.",

The most common approach is transmissive pulse\noximetry. In this approach, a sensor device is placed on a thin part of the patient's body, usually a\nfingertip or earlobe, or an infant's foot. The device passes two wavelengths of light through the\n&%BodyPart to a photodetector. It measures the changing absorbance at each of the wavelengths, allowing\nit to determine the absorbances due to the pulsing arterial blood alone, excluding venous blood, skin,\n&%Bone, &%Muscle, &%FatTissue, and, in most cases, nail polish.

This includes both\nsedentary and migratory populations. While overall widespread and numerous,\nsome of its subspecies are rare and at least one has already become\nextinct. For this reason, it is considered to be vulnerable by the IUCN.\nReindeer vary considerably in colour and size. Both sexes can grow antlers\nannually, although the proportion of females that grow antlers varies greatly\nbetween population and season. Antlers are typically larger on males. Hunting\nof wild reindeer and herding of semi-domesticated reindeer (for meat, hides,\nantlers, milk and transportation) are important to several Arctic and Subarctic\npeoples. In Lapland, reindeer pull pulks. In traditional festive legend,\nSanta Claus's reindeer pull a sleigh through the night sky to help Santa Claus\ndeliver gifts to children on Christmas Eve.

A gust is followed by a lull (or slackening) in the wind speed. \nThe average value of wind speed is generally measured over a period of 2 minutes \nbefore the meteorological observation according to the World Meteorological Organization.  \nIt is generally reported in METAR when the peak wind speed reaches at least 16 knots \n(30 km/h; 18 mph) and the variation in wind speed between the peaks and average wind \nis at least 9 to 10 knots (17 to 19 km/h; 10 to 12 mph).[Wikipedia]",
