Hellfire uses laser guidance and is\ndesigned to accept other guidance packages.  It is used on helicopters\nagainst heavily armored vehicles at longer standoff distances than any\nother U.S.  Army missiles now in the inventory.  The Hellfire II is the\noptimized version of the laser family of Hellfire missiles.  The Longbow\nHellfire Modular Missile System is an air-launched, radar aided,\ninertially guided missile that utilizes millimeter-wave radar technology.\nDespite the expanded acronym, most versions of the Hellfire missile are\nnot truly fire-and-forget -- all the laser-guided versions require\nconstant illumination or painting of the target from launch to impact.\nThe AGM-114L is a true fire-and-forget weapon: it requires no further\nguidance after launch and can hit its target without the launcher being in\nline of sight of the target.  The Hellfire (along with the Maverick and\nthe air-launched TOW) was to be replaced by the Joint Common Missile (JCM)\naround 2011.  The JCM was developed with a tri-mode seeker and a\nmulti-purpose warhead that would combine the capabilities of the several\nHellfire variants.  In the budget for FY2006, the US Department of Defense\ncanceled a number of projects that they felt no longer warranted\ncontinuation based on their cost effectiveness, including the JCM.  Due to\nthe U.S.  military's continuing need for a proven precision-strike\naviation weapon in the interim until a successor to the JCM is fielded, as\nwell as extensive foreign sales, it is likely the Hellfire will be in\nservice for many years.

As with other strepsirrhine\nprimates, such as lorises, pottos, and galagos (bush babies), lemurs share\nresemblance with basal primates.

It is nicknamed Ma Deuce by US troops or simply called\nfifty caliber machine gun. The design has had many specific\ndesignations- the official designation for the infantry type is\nBrowning Machine Gun, Heavy Barrel, Cal. .50, M2, HB, Flexible. The\nBrowning .50 machine gun was used extensively as a vehicle weapon and\nfor aircraft armament by the United States from the 1920s to the\npresent day. It was heavily used during World War II, Korean War, the\nVietnam Conflict, as well as during operations in Iraq in the 1990s\nand 2000s. It is the primary heavy machine gun of NATO countries, and\nhas been used by many other countries. It is still in use today. It\nwas very similar in design to the smaller Browning Model 1919 machine\ngun .30-06 Springfield.\nType \tFully-automatic machine gun\nCaliber \t.50 in (12.7 mm)\nAmmunition \t.50 BMG\nFeed system \tBelt-fed\nAction \tRecoil-operated, short recoil\nLength \t1,650 mm (65 in)\nBarrel length \t1,140 mm (44 7/8 in)\nWeight \t38 kg (58 kg w/ tripod)\nRate of fire \t550 round/min\nMuzzle velocity \t3,050 ft/s (930 m/s)\nEffective range \t2,000 m (2200 yards)\n (from Wikipedia)",

Three important differences between the M3M and the M2 BMG:\n1) The new weapon uses an open bolt 2) has an internal recoil spring,\nand 3) a significantly longer barrel life.  The first difference means\nthat cook-offs are far less likely to occur while the second point means\nthat the M3M has only a third as much non-compensated recoil as compared\nto the M2 BMG.  As a personal note, I have been on a firing range where\nthree out of four M2 BMGs had cook-offs following prolonged firing.  Some\nproblems noted during the initial evaluation of this weapon by the US\nMarines in 2001 included: 1) Significantly increased reload times compared\nto the M2 BMG.  2) Lengths of rounds were repeatedly pulled from the 100\nround magazines by the airstream, resulting in hazards to personnel and\nequipment.  3) Lack of a flash suppressor, which made this weapon almost\nimpossible to use with night-vision equipment.

The Mk 19 fires 40mm grenades at a cyclic rate of 300 to 400\nrounds per minute, giving a practical rate of fire of 60 rpm (rapid) and\n40 rpm (sustained).  The weapon operates on the blowback principle, which\nuses the chamber pressure from each fired round to load and re-cock the\nweapon.  The Mk 19 is able to lob its grenade at a maximum distance of\n2.2km, though its effective range is about 1.6km.  The nearest safe\ndistance to launch the grenade is 75 meters.  In addition, the Mk 19's\nflash suppressor and its lack of smoke during firing makes it difficult\nfor enemies to spot and counter it.
