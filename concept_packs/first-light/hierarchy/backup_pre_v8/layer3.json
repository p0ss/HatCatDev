The position of the Equator is fixed (90 degrees from \nEarth's axis of rotation) but the latitudes of the other circles depend on the tilt of this \naxis relative to the plane of Earth's orbit, and so are not perfectly fixed.

The hermatypic corals obtain much of their nutrient\nrequirement from symbiotic unicellular algae called zooxanthellae, and so\nare dependent upon growing in sunlight.  As a result, these corals are\nusually found not far beneath the surface, although in clear waters corals\ncan grow at depths of 60 m (200 ft).  Corals breed by spawning, with all\ncorals of the same species in a region releasing gametes simultaneously\nover a period of one to several nights around a full moon. (from Wikipedia)",

Other\nsymptoms depend on the underlying cause. Causes may include venous\ninsufficiency, heart failure, kidney problems, low protein levels,\nliver problems, deep vein thrombosis, infections, angioedema, certain\nmedications, and lymphedema. It may also occur after prolonged\nsitting or standing and during menstruation or pregnancy. The\ncondition is more concerning if it starts suddenly, or pain or\nshortness of breath is present. Treatment depends on the underlying\ncause. If the underlying mechanism involves sodium retention,\ndecreased salt intake and a diuretic may be used. Elevating the\nlegs and support stockings may be useful for edema of the legs.\nOlder people are more commonly affected. [from Wikipedia]",

Nerves have historically been considered\nthe basic units of the peripheral nervous system. A nerve provides a common pathway for the electrochemical\nnerve impulses called action potentials that are transmitted along each of the axons to peripheral organs or,\nin the case of sensory nerves, from the periphery back to the central nervous system. Each axon, within the\nnerve, is an extension of an individual neuron, along with other supportive cells such as some Schwann cells that\ncoat the axons in myelin. Within a nerve, each axon is surrounded by a layer of connective tissue called the\nendoneurium. The axons are bundled together into groups called fascicles, and each fascicle is wrapped in a\nlayer of connective tissue called the perineurium. Finally, the entire nerve is wrapped in a layer of connective\ntissue called the epineurium. Nerve cells (often called neurons) are further classified as sensory, motor, or mixed nerves.\nIn the central nervous system, the analogous structures are known as nerve tracts.[from Wikipedia]",

      "definition": "A nerve is an enclosed, cable_like bundle of nerve fibers (called axons)\nin the peripheral nervous system. Axons transmit electrical impulses. Nerves have historically been considered\nthe basic units of the peripheral nervous system. A nerve provides a common pathway for the electrochemical\nnerve impulses called action potentials that are transmitted along each of the axons to peripheral organs or,\nin the case of sensory nerves, from the periphery back to the central nervous system. Each axon, within the\nnerve, is an extension of an individual neuron, along with other supportive cells such as some Schwann cells that\ncoat the axons in myelin. Within a nerve, each axon is surrounded by a layer of connective tissue called the\nendoneurium. The axons are bundled together into groups called fascicles, and each fascicle is wrapped in a\nlayer of connective tissue called the perineurium. Finally, the entire nerve is wrapped in a layer of connective\ntissue called the epineurium. Nerve cells (often called neurons) are further classified as sensory, motor, or mixed nerves.\nIn the central nervous system, the analogous structures are known as nerve tracts.[from Wikipedia]",

The purpose of PSYOP is to induce or reinforce\nforeign attitudes and behaviors favorable to the JFC's\nobjectives. Planning and employment considerations include:\n\n(1) Force Multiplier. PSYOP are among the most effective nonlethal\nweapons available to a commander. It can reduce casualties on both\nsides by reducing the morale and combat effectiveness of the\nadversary, creating dissent and disaffection within their ranks,\nencouraging surrenders or defections, promoting disobedience, or\ninducing a lack of support for a hostile regime within a civilian\npopulace.\n\n(2) Combatant Commander Responsibilities. Each geographic combatant\ncommander is responsible for conducting PSYOP programs in\npeacetime. Such efforts are designed to create a favorable image of\nthe friendly government, of the United States, and of the Armed Forces\nof the United States, encourage support for democratic institutions,\nhuman rights, regional stability, and counterdrug activities, and\nassist a HN in explaining and publicizing humanitarian and civic\naction projects to local citizens. When used as part of an integrated\ntheater strategy or strategic information operation, PSYOP can reduce\nthe probability of conflict, reduce the damage if conflict does occur,\nand speed the transition to normality in the postconflict phase.\n\n(3) PSYOP Applications. Taking advantage of their language and culture\nskills, in-depth knowledge of the region, and understanding of\ninteragency operations, SOF provide the geographic combatant commander\nwith a broad range of PSYOP capabilities to be employed independently\nor in support of a larger theater campaign. These capabilities include\nthe following:\n\n(a) Developing, Producing, Distributing, and Disseminating. PSYOP\nunits design, develop, and produce programs. They distribute and\ndisseminate products that support tactical, operational, and strategic\ngoals.\n\n(b) Coordinating and Directing PSYOP Programs. PSYOP support national\npolicy goals with programs developed for and approved by higher\nauthority. PSYOP personnel coordinate with the chain of command to\nensure the credibility and effectiveness of the program.\n\n(c) Producing PSYOP Studies and Estimates. PSYOP personnel produce and\nmaintain studies and estimates for the commander. They advise\nsupported commanders on the expected psychological impacts of their\ncourses of action (COAs). They identify the adversary PSYOP effort and\nthe susceptibilities of friendly forces.\n\n(d) Support Enemy Prisoner of War (EPW), Civilian Internee (CI), and\nDislocated Civilian (DC) Operations. PSYOP support can dispel rumors,\ncreate dialogue and pacify or indoctrinate EPWs, CIs, or DCs to\nminimize violence, facilitate efficient camp operations, and ensure\nsafe and humane conditions persist.\n\n(e) Providing Support to HN Assistance Operations. During CMO, PSYOP\npersonnel may work with CA or conventional units to promote civic\naction projects either by or in support of the host government.\n\n(f) Employ Tactical PSYOP. Tactical PSYOP forces, with augmentation,\nare capable of providing all functions of PSYOP, on a limited scale,\nto component commands within a designated area of operations (AO).\n\n(4) PSYOP Support to Information Operations. PSYOP are a core\ncapability of IO. PSYOP activities are integrated into IO plans and\nsynchronized with IO objectives and themes. Mission-type orders and\ndecentralized execution can give PSYOP forces considerable autonomy to\nconduct tactical operations within established IO guidance. For\nadditional information on PSYOP, see JP 3-53, Doctrine for Joint\nPsychological Operations.\n",
