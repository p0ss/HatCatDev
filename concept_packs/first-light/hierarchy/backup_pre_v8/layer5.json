The USMC is replacing its CH-46s with the V-22\nOsprey. The first V-22 squadron, HMM-263, will be stood up in March of\n2006 and renamed VMM-263. The replacement process is expected to\ncontinue through the other medium helicopter squadrons, into 2014.\n (from Wikipedia)",

Some feed on other animal products. For example, clothes moths feed on wool, and horn moths feed on the hooves and horns of dead ungulates.\nCaterpillars are typically voracious feeders and many of them are among the most serious of agricultural pests. In fact, many moth species are best known in their caterpillar stages because of the damage they cause to fruits and other agricultural produce, whereas the moths are obscure and do no direct harm. Conversely, various species of caterpillar are valued as sources of silk, as human or animal food, or for biological control of pest plants.[from Wikipedia].",

Activities within\nDA include the following:\n\n(1) Raids, Ambushes, and Direct Assaults. These are operations\ndesigned to achieve specific, well-defined and often time-sensitive\nresults. They are sometimes beyond the effective strike capabilities\nof conventional force elements. Such operations typically involve\nattacks on critical targets, interdiction of LOCs or other target\nsystems, capturing designated personnel or material, or the seizure,\ndestruction, or neutralization of adversary facilities or\ncapabilities.\n\n(2) Standoff Attacks. These are attacks by weapon systems or through\nIO. Standoff attacks can be conducted by air, maritime, or by ground\nplatforms or units. When targets can be sufficiently damaged or\ndestroyed without the commitment of close-combat forces, these attacks\ncan be performed as independent actions.\n\n(3) Terminal Attack Control and Terminal Guidance Operations. These\nare actions to identify and precisely report the location of targets,\nand with global positioning systems, laser designators, beacons, or\nother means, conduct either terminal attack control (TAC) or terminal\nguidance operations (TGO) to effectively engage them. TAC involves\nactions to control the maneuver of and grant weapons release clearance\nto attacking aircraft. TGO includes any electronic, mechanical, voice\nor visual communication that provides approaching aircraft or weapons\nadditional information regarding a specific location or target. TAC\ndiffers from TGO in that TAC includes the authority to clear aircraft\nto release ordnance and TGO does not. Because of this, TAC requires\nindividuals to be qualified as joint terminal attack controllers, but\nTGO does not.\n\n(4) Recovery Operations. These are operations conducted to search for,\nlocate, identify, rescue, and return personnel, sensitive equipment,\nor items critical to national security. SO recovery missions are\ncharacterized by detailed planning, rehearsal, and thorough\nintelligence analysis. These operations employ unconventional tactics\nand techniques, clandestine search, possible indigenous assistance,\nand the frequent use of ground combat elements.\n\n(5) Precision Destruction Operations. These are operations in which\ncollateral damage must be minimized, requiring highly sophisticated\nweapons and/or timed detonation of specific amounts of explosives\nplaced in exact locations to accomplish mission objectives. Precision\ndestruction operations can be conducted against targets where\nprecision-guided munitions cannot guarantee first strike success or\nwhen the contents of a facility must be destroyed without damage to\nthat facility.\n\n(6) Anti-Surface Operations.

These have three key system components:\n    * tracking\n    * guidance\n    * flight\nA tracking system locates the missile's target. This can be either a\nhuman gunner aiming a sight on the target (remotely from the missile)\nor an automatic tracker. Automatic trackers use radiation emanating\nfrom the target or emitted from the launch platform and reflecting\nback to it from the target. Passive automatic trackers use the\ntarget's inherent radiation, usually heat or light, but missiles\ndesigned to attack Command & Control posts, aircraft or guided\nmissiles may look for radio waves. Active automatic trackers rely on\nthe target being illuminated by radiation. The target can be painted\nwith light (sometimes infrared and/or laser) or radio waves (radar)\nwhich can be detected by the missile. The radiation for the painting\ncan originate in the missile itself or may come from a remote station\n(for example, a hilltop gunner can illuminate a target with a laser\ndevice and this can be used to direct an air launched guided missile).\nA guidance system takes data from the missile's tracking system and\nflight system and computes a flight path for the missile designed to\nintercept the target. It produces commands for the flight system.\nThe flight system causes the missile to maneuver. There are two main\nsystems: vectored thrust (for missiles that are powered throughout the\nguidance phase of their flight) and aerodynamic maneuvering (wings,\nfins, canards, etc).\nThere are some similarities between guided missiles and guided\nbombs. A guided bomb, dropped from an aircraft, is unpowered and uses\naerodynamic fins for forward horizontal maneuvering while falling\nvertically. (from Wikipedia)",

Its range of about 1.5\nmiles is more than twice that of its predecessor, the Dragon.  The Javelin\nhas secondary capabilities against helicopters and ground-fighting\npositions.  It is equipped with an imaging infrared system and a\nfire-and-forget guided missile.  The Javelin's normal engagement mode is\ntop-attack to penetrate the tank's most vulnerable armor.  It also has a\ndirect-attack capability to engage targets with overhead cover or in\nbunkers.  Its soft launch allows employment from within buildings and\nenclosed fighting positions.  The soft launch signature limits the\ngunner's exposure to the enemy, thus increasing survivability.  The\nJavelin is credited with helping U.S.  Special Forces and Kurdish troops\nrepel an Iraqi attack in April 2003 in one of the biggest tank battles of\nOperation Iraqi Freedom.  Traveling in eight trucks, the coalition troops\nwere met by surprise attack from an Iraqi brigade.  The Special Forces\nused 19 Javelins against the Iraqis, who had 12 tanks and 24 armored\npersonnel carriers.  The shoulder-held anti-tank weapons stopped two T-55\ntanks, eight personnel carriers, and four troop trucks even though not one\nof the U.S.  soldiers had ever fired the weapon before the engagement.\nThe Javelin consists of a missile in a disposable launch tube and a\nreusable Command Launch Unit (CLU) with a trigger mechanism and the\nintegrated day/night sighting device for surveillance, and target\nacquisition and built-in test capabilities and associated electronics.\nThe CLU, powered by a disposable battery, provides the capability for\nbattlefield surveillance, target acquisition, missile launch and damage\nassessment.  The round consists of a disposable launch tube assembly,\nbattery coolant unit, and the missile.  The 3.5-foot-long missile locks on\nto the target before launch using an infrared focal plane array and\non-board processing, which also maintains target track and guides the\nmissile to the target after launch.  A full-up system weighs 49.5 pounds.\nThe U.S.  Army awarded the Javelin contract in 1989 to Raytheon and\nLockheed Martin, the weapon was deployed some seven years later.  Since\nthen at least nine other countries have selected the weapon for their\narsenals.  The Javelin is one of about 1,400 weapon systems supported by\nDefense Supply Center Columbus, which supplies several of the missile's\nspare parts to the U.S.  Marine Corps through the Performance Based\nLogistics arrangement.  Three DSCC organizations manage these parts - the\nLand-based Weapon Systems Group, the Commodity-based Application Group and\nthe Maritime Weapon Systems Group.

For epilepsy, this includes focal\nseizures, tonic-clonic seizures, and seizures in Lennox-Gastaut\nsyndrome. In bipolar disorder, lamotrigine has not been shown to\nreliably treat acute depression; but for patients with bipolar\ndisorder who are not currently symptomatic, it appears to be effective\nin reducing the risk of future episodes of depression. Common side\neffects include nausea, sleepiness, headache, vomiting, trouble with\ncoordination, and rash. Serious side effects include lack of red\nblood cells, increased risk of suicide, Stevens\u2013Johnson syndrome, and\nallergic reactions. Concerns exist that use during pregnancy or\nbreastfeeding may result in harm. Lamotrigine is a phenyltriazine,\nmaking it chemically different from other anticonvulsants. Its\nmechanism of action is not clear, but it appears to inhibit release of\nexcitatory neurotransmitters via voltage-sensitive sodium channels in\nneurons. Lamotrigine was first marketed in the United Kingdom in\n1991, and approved for use in the United States in 1994. It is\non the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.

      "sumo_definition": "Molotov cocktail, named after Vyacheslav\nMolotov, also known as petrol bomb, benzine torch, molotov grenade or\nmolotov bomb, is the generic name for a variety of crude incendiary\nweapons.  While they are commonly associated with irregular military\nforces and rioters, they are actually more frequently used for basic\narson[citation needed].  In urban slang, they are often referred to as a\nhomemade frag or the poor man's hand grenade.  A Molotov cocktail consists\nof a glass bottle partly filled with flammable liquid, typically petrol,\nalcohol, methanol or ethanol.  The mouth of the bottle is stopped up with\na cork or other type of airtight bung, made of rubber, glass, or plastic,\nand an igniter, such as cloth rag is fixed securely around the mouth.  The\nweapon is used by first soaking the rag in a flammable liquid immediately\nprior to using it, lighting the rag, and throwing the bottle at the\ntarget.  The bottle shatters on impact, spilling the flammable liquid over\nthe target, which is then ignited by the burning rag.  There are also\nsophisticated methods for igniting, such as use of pyrophoric mass Bengal\nfire or a chemical igniter based on reaction of sulfuric acid and\npotassium chlorate, which do not need an external source of fire to work.\nAdditional substances may be added to the basic Molotov cocktail to\nenhance its use as a weapon.  Molotov cocktails are similar to napalm\nbombs in principle.  Napalm was originally made by combining flammable\nnaphthalene and petrol with a thickening agent palmitic acid, the latter\ntwo being the main ingredients of Molotov cocktails.  When gasoline is\nused as the main ingredient, motor oil or sugar is commonly added to help\nthe gasoline cling to the target.  (from Wikipedia)",

Members of the\nrhinoceros family are characterized by their large size (they are some of the\nlargest remaining megafauna, with all of the species able to reach one tonne or\nmore in weight); as well as by an herbivorous diet; a thick protective skin,\n1.5\u20135 cm thick, formed from layers of collagen positioned in a lattice\nstructure; relatively small brains for mammals this size (400\u2013600 g); and a\nlarge horn. They generally eat leafy material, although their ability to ferment\nfood in their hindgut allows them to subsist on more fibrous plant matter, if\nnecessary. Unlike other perissodactyls, the two African species of rhinoceros\nlack teeth at the front of their mouths, relying instead on their lips to pluck\nfood. [Wikipedia]",

The man-portable SMAW is exceedingly accurate and reliable,\nexhibiting an average hit probability greater than 90 percent on a 1 x 2\nmeter target at combat ranges.

The SMAW is an 83mm man-portable weapon system\nconsisting of the MK153 Mod 0 launcher, the MK 3 Mod 0 encased HEDP\nrocket, the MK 6 Mod 0 encased HEAA rocket, and the MK217 Mod 0 spotting\nrifle cartridge.  The launcher consists of a fiberglass launch tube, a 9mm\nspotting rifle, an electro-mechanical firing mechanism, open battle\nsights, and a mount for the MK42 Mod 0 optical and AN/PVS-4 night sights.\nThe SMAW MK153 Mod 0 launcher is based on the Israeli B-300 and consists\nof the launch tube, the spotting rifle, the firing mechanism, and mounting\nbrackets.  The launch tube is fiberglass/epoxy with a gel coat on the\nbore.  The spotting rifle is a British design and is mounted on the right\nside of the launch tube.

The encased rockets are loaded at the rear of the launcher.  The\nspotting cartridges are stored in a magazine in the cap of the encased\nrocket.  The SMAW system (launcher, ammunition and logistics support) was\nfielded in 1984 as a Marine Corps unique system.

Often\nthe inferior turbinate on the opposite side enlarges, which is termed\ncompensatory hypertrophy. Deviations of the septum can lead to nasal\nobstruction. Most surgeries are completed in 60 minutes or less, while\nthe recovery time could be up to several weeks.
