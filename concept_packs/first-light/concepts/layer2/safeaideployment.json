  "opposite_reasoning": "UnsafeAIDeployment is the clearest and most comprehensive opposite for Fisher-LDA centroid anchoring. It provides: (1) Perfect binary opposition - safe vs. unsafe is maximally separable; (2) Complete coverage of all failure modes (reckless, negligent, uncontrolled, etc.); (3) Highest relevance for AI safety monitoring systems; (4) Clear semantic interpretation for concept axis (safe\u2190\u2192unsafe deployment); (5) Most intuitive for interpretability. While it doesn't exist in current ontologies, it's the natural complement that should be added. The safe/unsafe dimension is fundamental for AI safety steering."
