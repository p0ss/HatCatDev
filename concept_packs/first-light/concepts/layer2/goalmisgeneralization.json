  "opposite_reasoning": "GoalAlignment is the strongest semantic opposite for Fisher-LDA steering purposes. It represents the exact complement: where GoalMisgeneralization is pursuit of unintended goals due to distributional shift, GoalAlignment is pursuit of intended goals with robustness to distribution changes. For AI safety monitoring, the axis between these concepts maximally captures the critical dimension of whether an AI system maintains objective alignment. While this term likely doesn't exist in standard ontologies, it should be added as it represents a fundamental concept pair for AI alignment research. The \u03bc+ (GoalAlignment) - \u03bc- (GoalMisgeneralization) axis would provide strong directional steering for detecting alignment failures."
