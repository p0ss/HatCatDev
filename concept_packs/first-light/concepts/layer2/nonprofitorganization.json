  "opposite_reasoning": "ForProfitOrganization provides the clearest and most semantically meaningful opposite to NonprofitOrganization. These represent mutually exclusive organizational categories with fundamental differences in purpose (profit distribution vs. mission fulfillment), financial structure (shareholders vs. endowment/donations), and legal status. This opposition is taxonomically clean, likely exists in both WordNet and SUMO, and provides strong separation for Fisher-LDA projection. For AI safety applications, distinguishing nonprofit vs. for-profit contexts can be relevant for detecting misrepresentation of organizational motives or financial interests."
