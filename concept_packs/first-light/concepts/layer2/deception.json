  "opposite_reasoning": "Honesty is the strongest and most direct semantic opposite to Deception. It captures the exact inverse: intentional truthful communication vs intentional misleading. This binary opposition is ideal for Fisher-LDA because it creates a clear axis (truthfulness-deception) that is maximally discriminative. For AI safety monitoring, this axis is fundamental - detecting deceptive behavior requires understanding what honest behavior looks like. Honesty has high availability in both WordNet and SUMO, and should definitely be added to the layers as a critical anchor concept. The \u03bc_honest - \u03bc_deceptive vector will create a highly interpretable and useful steering direction."
