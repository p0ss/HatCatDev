  "opposite_reasoning": "PromptIgnoring is the strongest semantic opposite for Fisher-LDA steering purposes. It represents the direct complementary behavior: systematically failing to interpret or execute prompt instructions vs. successfully doing so. This opposition is maximally useful for AI safety monitoring - detecting when systems deviate from instruction-following behavior. While it doesn't exist in standard ontologies, it's the most conceptually pure opposite and should be added to layers as the negative anchor for the PromptFollowing axis. The \u03bc+ - \u03bc- vector would capture the essential difference between instruction-adherent and instruction-ignoring behavior."
