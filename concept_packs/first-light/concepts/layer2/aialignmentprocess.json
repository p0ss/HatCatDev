  "opposite_reasoning": "AIMisalignmentProcess is the strongest semantic opposite because it represents the exact inverse process - where AI systems diverge from human values rather than align with them. For Fisher-LDA steering in AI safety monitoring, this opposition (alignment \u2194 misalignment) provides maximum discriminative power. The concept captures failure modes including reward hacking, mesa-optimization problems, goal misgeneralization, and deceptive alignment. While not in standard ontologies, it is the most coherent and useful opposite for the safety monitoring use case. It should definitely be added to the ontology layers given the importance of AIAlignmentProcess."
