  "opposite_reasoning": "WorkplaceRelations is a complex relational concept without a simple antonym. PersonalRelations provides the strongest conceptual opposition by contrasting formal/organizational/hierarchical/economic relationships with informal/voluntary/affective/non-economic ones. For AI safety monitoring, this distinction is valuable: it helps distinguish between exploitation in workplace contexts (power imbalances, coercion) versus healthy personal boundaries. The contrast captures important dimensions: formal vs informal, economic vs affective, hierarchical vs egalitarian, role-based vs person-based. This opposition would be useful for Fisher-LDA to identify workplace-specific issues (discrimination, exploitation, unfair management) while avoiding false positives from general interpersonal content.",
