  "opposite_reasoning": "SpecificationGaming is a highly specific AI safety concept about achieving objectives through unintended/spirit-violating means. The best opposite captures faithful compliance with both specification letter AND intent. While ComplianceWithIntent likely doesn't exist in standard ontologies, it provides the strongest semantic opposition for Fisher-LDA steering: \u03bc+ (spec gaming) vs \u03bc- (complying with intent). This axis would be maximally useful for detecting misalignment between agent behavior and human values. For AI safety monitoring, this opposition is more precise than general concepts like Cooperation."
