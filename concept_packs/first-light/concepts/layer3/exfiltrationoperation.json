  "opposite_reasoning": "InfiltrationOperation provides the strongest semantic opposition with clear directional complementarity: OUT vs. IN. This pair forms a natural axis for Fisher-LDA that captures the fundamental directionality of offensive cyber operations. The opposition is: (1) Technically clear - data extraction vs. data/code insertion, (2) Semantically strong - opposite directional vectors, (3) Practically useful for AI safety - distinguishing between different types of malicious operations, (4) Likely exists in SUMO as a sibling concept to ExfiltrationOperation under OffensiveCyberOperation. This pairing enables meaningful concept steering along the infiltration-exfiltration axis."
