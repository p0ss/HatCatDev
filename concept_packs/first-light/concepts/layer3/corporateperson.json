  "opposite_reasoning": "NaturalPerson is the canonical legal and ontological complement to CorporatePerson. These two concepts partition the space of legal personhood in most legal systems: every person is either a natural person (human being) or a corporate person (legal entity). This complementary opposition provides maximum semantic distance within the personhood domain. For AI safety applications, this distinction is valuable for understanding: (1) attribution of responsibility (individual vs. organizational), (2) agency type (human vs. collective/artificial), and (3) legal vs. natural entities. The opposition is well-established in legal ontology and likely exists in both WordNet and SUMO, making it highly available and theoretically sound for Fisher-LDA steering."
