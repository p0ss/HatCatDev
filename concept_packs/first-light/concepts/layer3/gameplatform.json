  "opposite_reasoning": "NaturalObject provides the strongest and most ontologically sound opposition to GamePlatform. It contrasts artificial/technological artifacts with natural entities, creating a clear semantic axis between human-designed computational infrastructure and naturally occurring objects. This opposition is well-established in SUMO ontology, highly available in knowledge bases, and provides meaningful semantic distance for Fisher-LDA centroid anchoring. While not directly relevant to deception detection, it establishes a fundamental artifact vs. nature distinction that is conceptually clean and mathematically useful for dimensional reduction."
