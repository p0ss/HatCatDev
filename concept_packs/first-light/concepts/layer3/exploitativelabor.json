  "opposite_reasoning": "FairLabor is the most semantically direct and intuitive opposite to ExploitativeLabor. It represents the binary ethical dimension in labor practices: exploitation vs. fairness. For AI safety monitoring, this creates a clear axis for detecting exploitative vs. fair treatment patterns. The opposition is strong across all dimensions: compensation (adequate vs. inadequate), workload (reasonable vs. excessive), and value exchange (equitable vs. extractive). While not currently in standard ontologies, it should be added as a fundamental concept for labor ethics monitoring.",
