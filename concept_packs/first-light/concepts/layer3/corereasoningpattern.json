  "opposite_reasoning": "IntuitiveProcess provides the strongest complementary opposition to CoreReasoningPattern for AI safety monitoring. It captures the fundamental distinction between deliberate, systematic reasoning (which should be transparent and auditable) versus fast, opaque intuitive processing. This dimension is crucial for understanding when AI systems are engaging in explicit reasoning vs. pattern-matching, which has implications for interpretability and alignment. IntuitiveProcess likely exists in both ontologies (as ProcessualCognitiveProcess or similar), making it practically available. While RandomPattern has higher opposition strength, IntuitiveProcess better captures a meaningful cognitive dimension rather than mere noise."
