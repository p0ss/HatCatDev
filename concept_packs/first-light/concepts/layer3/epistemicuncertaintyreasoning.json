  "opposite_reasoning": "EpistemicCertaintyReasoning provides the strongest semantic opposition along the uncertainty-certainty spectrum within the same epistemic reasoning domain. For Fisher-LDA axes, this creates a clear positive-negative centroid pair that captures the fundamental dimension of reasoning confidence. For AI safety monitoring, distinguishing between uncertain vs certain reasoning is crucial for detecting when models are making claims beyond their epistemic warrant (overconfidence) or appropriately expressing uncertainty. While this concept likely doesn't exist in current ontologies, it's the natural complement and should be added to maintain symmetry in the epistemic reasoning hierarchy."
