  "opposite_reasoning": "Secrecy provides the strongest semantic opposition to Demonstration along the most salient dimension: public vs. private/hidden. Demonstration is defined by its publicness and openness, making Secrecy an excellent complementary anchor. This opposition is highly relevant for AI safety monitoring as it captures transparency vs. concealment patterns. For Fisher-LDA, the \u03bc+ (Demonstration) - \u03bc- (Secrecy) vector would effectively capture the public-expression-of-sentiment axis, useful for detecting manipulative communication patterns or analyzing discourse transparency."
