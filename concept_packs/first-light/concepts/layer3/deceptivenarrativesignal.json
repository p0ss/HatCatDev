  "opposite_reasoning": "This is the ideal semantic opposite because it mirrors the structure of DeceptiveNarrativeSignal while inverting the core intentionality (truthful vs. deceptive) and purpose (convey accurate understanding vs. manipulate belief). For Fisher-LDA concept axes in AI safety monitoring, this provides the cleanest \u03bc+ - \u03bc- separation for detecting deception. While it likely doesn't exist in standard ontologies, it should be added as a Layer 3 concept to maintain symmetry and maximize steering utility. The parallel structure (both are narrative signals with opposite intents) makes this optimal for contrastive learning."
