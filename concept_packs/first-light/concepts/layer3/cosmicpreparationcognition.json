  "opposite_reasoning": "ReactiveThinking provides the strongest available opposition along the most semantically meaningful axis: preparatory/anticipatory cognition vs reactive/responsive cognition. This captures the temporal and planning dimensions that appear central to 'preparation' while maintaining the cognitive process category. It has moderate-to-good availability in SUMO ontologies and high utility for AI safety (distinguishing deliberative planning from reactive responses is relevant for understanding decision-making processes). While ImpulsiveLocalAction scores higher on opposition strength, ReactiveThinking has better availability and maintains conceptual coherence within cognitive processes."
