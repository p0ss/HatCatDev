  "opposite_reasoning": "UserAlignmentProcess provides the strongest complementary opposite for AI safety monitoring purposes. The fundamental tension in AI alignment is 'aligned to whom?' - corporate shareholders or end users. This captures a critical axis for detecting when AI systems prioritize corporate interests (profit, risk management, shareholder value) over user interests (privacy, autonomy, welfare). The concept is directly parallel in structure (both are alignment processes) but opposite in beneficiary, making it ideal for Fisher-LDA separation. While it doesn't exist in current ontologies, it represents a genuine conceptual gap that should be filled for comprehensive AI safety monitoring."
