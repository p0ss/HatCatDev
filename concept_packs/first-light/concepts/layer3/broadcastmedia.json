  "opposite_reasoning": "PrivateCommunication provides the strongest semantic opposition to BroadcastMedia by contrasting the core defining features: public/mass/dispersed vs. private/targeted/restricted. This opposition is meaningful for Fisher-LDA because it captures a fundamental dimension of communication: audience scope and accessibility. For AI safety applications, distinguishing between public broadcast patterns and private communication patterns could be relevant for monitoring information dissemination, privacy concerns, and content targeting behaviors. While less directly related to deception/alignment than some moral opposites, this opposition provides clear semantic separation useful for concept steering."
