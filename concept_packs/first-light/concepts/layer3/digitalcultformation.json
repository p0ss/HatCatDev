  "opposite_reasoning": "CriticalThinking provides the strongest combination of semantic opposition and AI safety utility. Cult formation fundamentally requires suppression of critical evaluation, skepticism, and rational analysis. For Fisher-LDA concept axes, the CriticalThinking\u2194DigitalCultFormation axis would be highly useful for detecting manipulative patterns, echo chamber formation, and groupthink dynamics. CriticalThinking is also likely to exist in both WordNet and SUMO, making it practically available. While IndividualAutonomy scores similarly high, CriticalThinking is more directly about cognitive processes (matching the 'formation' process nature) and more actionable for content monitoring."
