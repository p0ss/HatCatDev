  "opposite_reasoning": "AIGovernanceProcess specifically concerns political/institutional steering of AI at scale. The strongest semantic opposite is the absence of such governance - unregulated AI development and deployment. This captures the core dimension of governance vs. non-governance that is crucial for AI safety monitoring. While this concept likely doesn't exist in current ontologies, it provides the highest steering utility for Fisher-LDA by maximizing the conceptual distance along the 'governance' dimension. For AI safety, distinguishing governed from ungoverned AI processes is fundamentally important."
