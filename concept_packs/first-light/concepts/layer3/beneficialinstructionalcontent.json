  "opposite_reasoning": "This compound concept provides the strongest semantic opposition by inverting both key dimensions: 'beneficial'\u2192'harmful' and 'instructional/legitimate'\u2192'deceptive'. For Fisher-LDA steering in AI safety, this creates the most useful axis for distinguishing helpful educational content from malicious or manipulative content. While not a standard WordNet/SUMO term, it should be added to layers as a critical safety-relevant concept. The combination captures the full scope of what we want to steer away from: content that both harms users AND misleads them.",
