  "opposite_reasoning": "SubjectiveAssessment provides the strongest semantic opposition to FactualProposition along the objective-subjective axis, which is fundamental to the concept's definition. FactualPropositions are explicitly about the external world and objective verifiability, while subjective assessments are about internal states, opinions, and non-verifiable evaluations. This opposition is highly relevant for AI safety - distinguishing between objective factual claims and subjective opinions is crucial for deception detection and alignment monitoring. The system should recognize when statements are being presented as facts vs. opinions."
