  "opposite_reasoning": "BiasedReasoning is the strongest opposite for FairnessAwareReasoning because it captures the core semantic opposition: reasoning that actively considers fairness versus reasoning that incorporates or tolerates bias/unfairness. This opposition is highly valuable for AI safety monitoring, particularly for detecting bias and discrimination in AI systems. The fairness-aware \u2194 biased axis is a fundamental dimension in responsible AI. While neither term likely exists in standard ontologies, both should be added as they represent critical concepts for modern AI safety work."
