  "opposite_reasoning": "PlainText provides the strongest functional and semantic opposition to CryptographicKey within the security/cryptography domain. The relationship is complementary and mutually exclusive in the encryption/decryption process: plaintext is what exists before encryption (and after decryption), while cryptographic keys are the tools that control this transformation. This opposition is highly relevant for AI safety monitoring around data security, privacy, and information disclosure. The concept likely exists in both WordNet and SUMO, making it practically available. For Fisher-LDA, this creates a meaningful axis separating encrypted/secure concepts from unencrypted/open concepts."
