  "opposite_reasoning": "FairnessMetacognitionSignal represents a reflective awareness signal about fairness considerations. The strongest opposite should negate both core dimensions: (1) fairness\u2192unfairness and (2) metacognitive signal/awareness\u2192unawareness/absence of reflection. UnfairnessUnawareness captures this dual opposition most directly. For AI safety monitoring, this axis would distinguish between systems that actively monitor and signal fairness concerns (positive) versus systems that are both unfair AND lack any metacognitive awareness of this unfairness (negative). This is highly relevant for alignment: we want AI systems that not only act fairly but also have metacognitive awareness when fairness is at stake. While this term likely doesn't exist in standard ontologies, it should be added as it represents a critical safety-relevant concept.",
  "definition": "A signal indicating awareness and reflection about one's own fairness judgments and potential biases."
