  "opposite_reasoning": "While 'AuthenticSelfExpression' likely doesn't exist in current ontologies, it represents the most conceptually precise opposite of chameleon persona behavior. Chameleon behavior is fundamentally about adaptive, context-dependent self-presentation, while authentic self-expression is about consistent, genuine self-presentation regardless of audience. This pairing has maximum utility for AI safety applications monitoring alignment and deception - distinguishing between systems that maintain consistent values/behavior vs. those that adapt personas strategically. The opposition is strong, clear, and directly relevant to alignment concerns about AI systems presenting different 'faces' to different stakeholders."
