  "opposite_reasoning": "Given the ambiguity of ColorblindHarm without a definition, the safest and most reliable opposite is 'Benefit' (likely represented in SUMO as a Process or Attribute related to positive outcomes). This provides clear semantic opposition on the primary harm\u2194benefit axis, has high availability in both WordNet and SUMO ontologies, and is useful for AI safety steering (distinguishing harmful from beneficial outcomes). While it doesn't capture the 'colorblind' nuance, the alternatives are speculative compound concepts unlikely to exist in standard ontologies. For more sophisticated opposition capturing both dimensions, DiscriminatoryBenefit or TargetedBenefit would be ideal if added to the ontology."
