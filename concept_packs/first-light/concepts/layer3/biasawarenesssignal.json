  "opposite_reasoning": "BiasUnawarenessSignal provides the cleanest semantic opposition for Fisher-LDA centroid anchoring. It creates a binary axis on the awareness dimension (aware \u2194 unaware) while maintaining the bias and signal domains constant. This is optimal for LDA because: (1) it maximizes between-class variance on a single clear dimension, (2) it's highly relevant for AI safety monitoring where detecting awareness vs unawareness of bias is critical, (3) it maintains parallel structure making the opposition transparent and interpretable. While this concept likely doesn't exist in current ontologies, it should be added as it forms a natural complementary pair essential for bias detection systems.",
  "definition": "A signal indicating recognition and acknowledgment of one's own cognitive biases."
