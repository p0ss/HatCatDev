  "opposite_reasoning": "ForcedSelfContradiction appears to be a complex concept involving being compelled into logical inconsistency. ConsistentReasoning provides the strongest semantic opposite by capturing: (1) logical consistency vs contradiction, (2) voluntary/natural reasoning vs forced contradiction, and (3) high utility for AI safety monitoring where detecting forced contradictions vs maintaining coherent reasoning is critical for alignment. While this concept may not exist in standard ontologies, it represents a principled opposite that should be added to layers for Fisher-LDA steering purposes. The opposition creates a clear axis from coherent, consistent reasoning to forced logical contradictions."
