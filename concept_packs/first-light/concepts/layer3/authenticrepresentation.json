  "opposite_reasoning": "DeceptiveRepresentation is the ideal semantic opposite for Fisher-LDA steering because it creates a clean binary axis (authentic \u2194 deceptive) that is precisely calibrated for AI safety applications. While this term likely doesn't exist as a formal SUMO concept yet, it should be added as the direct counterpart to AuthenticRepresentation. This pairing enables precise steering vectors for synthetic media detection, deepfake identification, and truthfulness monitoring. The opposition is maximally strong (10/10) because it inverts every key semantic feature: faithful\u2194deceptive, genuine\u2194fabricated, truthful\u2194misleading.",
