  "opposite_reasoning": "EqualTreatment provides the strongest direct conceptual opposition to DiscriminatoryTreatment at the same ontological level (both are processes/behaviors). This parallel structure is ideal for Fisher-LDA axes where we want \u03bc+ - \u03bc- to capture the discrimination\u2194equality dimension. For AI safety monitoring, this axis is crucial for detecting biased behavior patterns. While EqualTreatment may not exist as a standalone synset in WordNet, it likely exists in SUMO as a normative social concept, and if missing, should definitely be added given its importance for fairness-related AI safety applications."
