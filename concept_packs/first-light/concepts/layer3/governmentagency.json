  "opposite_reasoning": "PrivateOrganization provides the strongest and most semantically clear opposition to GovernmentAgency. It captures the fundamental public vs. private sector distinction that is both conceptually robust and practically useful for AI safety applications. This opposition is taxonomic (mutually exclusive organizational types), has high availability in both WordNet and SUMO, and would be valuable for distinguishing government vs. private sector contexts in monitoring systems. For Fisher-LDA, this provides a clean axis: government-authorized public service vs. privately-operated independent organization."
