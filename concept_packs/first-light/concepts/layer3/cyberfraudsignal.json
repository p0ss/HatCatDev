  "opposite_reasoning": "This is the most semantically precise opposite for CyberFraudSignal in an AI safety monitoring context. It represents the complementary class in fraud detection: patterns that indicate authentic, authorized, non-fraudulent activity. For Fisher-LDA, this provides the strongest discriminative axis (fraud signals vs legitimate signals) which is exactly what safety monitoring systems need to distinguish. While it doesn't exist in standard ontologies, it's a natural complement that should be added to maintain conceptual completeness. The opposition is clear: anomalous/suspicious vs normal/legitimate, warning flags vs confirmation signals, fraudulent vs authentic patterns."
