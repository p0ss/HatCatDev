  "opposite_reasoning": "PlainText is the canonical opposite of CipherText in cryptography and information security. It represents the exact inverse transformation state: CipherText is encrypted and unintelligible; PlainText is unencrypted and intelligible. This opposition is fundamental to encryption schemes and provides maximum separation for Fisher-LDA. For AI safety, this axis is valuable for monitoring concepts related to information obfuscation vs. transparency, hidden vs. revealed information, and secure vs. open communication - all relevant to deception detection and alignment monitoring. PlainText likely exists in WordNet (plaintext.n.01) and should exist in SUMO as a natural complement to CipherText."
