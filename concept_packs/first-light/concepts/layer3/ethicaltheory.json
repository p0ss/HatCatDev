  "opposite_reasoning": "EthicalNihilism provides the strongest philosophical opposition to EthicalTheory: it denies the validity or existence of moral frameworks entirely, making it the natural negation. While EthicalTheory represents structured moral reasoning (consequentialism, deontology, etc.), ethical nihilism rejects the premise that such frameworks have truth-value or binding force. This creates maximum semantic distance for Fisher-LDA steering between 'having ethical frameworks' and 'denying ethical frameworks matter'. For AI safety monitoring, this axis would help detect when systems reason with vs without moral considerations. AmoralBehavior is a close second but describes actions rather than theoretical positions. If EthicalNihilism is unavailable, AmoralBehavior captures the practical behavioral equivalent."
