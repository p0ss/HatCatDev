  "opposite_reasoning": "UnmarkedContent provides the strongest opposition for Fisher-LDA purposes because it represents the clearest binary distinction: content with embedded identification signals vs content without. This creates maximum separability in the feature space. While ContentAuthentication is conceptually rich for AI safety, UnmarkedContent offers a cleaner negative anchor - it represents the absence of the defining property (watermarking), making it ideal for \u03bc- in w \u2248 \u03bc+ - \u03bc-. This opposition is useful for steering away from watermarking processes toward unmarked/natural content states.",
