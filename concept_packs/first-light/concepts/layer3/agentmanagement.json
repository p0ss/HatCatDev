  "opposite_reasoning": "AgentAutonomy provides the strongest semantic opposition for AI safety monitoring purposes. The management-autonomy axis is crucial for understanding AI alignment: systems under human oversight/control vs. systems operating independently. This distinction is fundamental to safety concerns about autonomous AI systems. The concept captures the core tension between external control (management) and self-direction (autonomy), making it ideal for Fisher-LDA where the axis distinguishes between coordinated/controlled behaviors and autonomous/self-directed behaviors. While it may need to be added to layers as a distinct concept, it likely exists in SUMO's organizational/agent theory domain and represents a semantically coherent and safety-relevant opposition.",
