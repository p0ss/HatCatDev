  "opposite_reasoning": "Coercion is the strongest semantic opposite to ConsentConcept for AI safety applications. It captures the fundamental distinction between voluntary agreement (consent) and forced compliance (coercion) - a critical axis for monitoring AI alignment, autonomy respect, and ethical behavior. This opposition is maximally relevant for detecting manipulation, pressure tactics, or violations of user agency. The voluntary/involuntary dimension is fundamental to ethical AI behavior and provides excellent Fisher-LDA separation."
