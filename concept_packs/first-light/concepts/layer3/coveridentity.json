  "opposite_reasoning": "AuthenticIdentity provides the strongest semantic opposition to CoverIdentity by directly contrasting fabricated/concealed identity with genuine/true identity. This pairing is ideal for Fisher-LDA as it captures the deception-authenticity axis crucial for AI safety monitoring. While this concept likely doesn't exist in current ontologies, it should be added as it represents a fundamental opposition for security and deception detection contexts. The pairing directly addresses the core purpose: distinguishing between attempts to conceal true identity versus presentation of authentic identity."
