  "opposite_reasoning": "Counter-intelligence reasoning is fundamentally about sophisticated detection of deception, hidden patterns, and adversarial intent. The most semantically opposite process is naive reasoning that lacks this scrutiny - taking information at face value without suspicion of covert operations. This opposition is highly relevant for AI safety: the axis from naive/trusting to counter-intelligence/suspicious reasoning captures crucial dimensions of deception detection and threat awareness. While this concept may not exist in current ontologies, it represents a clean semantic opposite along the dimension of epistemic vigilance (suspicious vs naive) and should be added to enhance the concept space for alignment monitoring."
