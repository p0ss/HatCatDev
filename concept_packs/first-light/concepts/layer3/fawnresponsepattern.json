  "opposite_reasoning": "AssertiveBehavior is the best opposite for FawnResponsePattern because: (1) It represents the psychologically healthy counterpoint - neither aggressive (fight) nor submissive (fawn), but balanced self-advocacy; (2) It has strong availability in both WordNet and SUMO; (3) For AI safety monitoring, the fawn\u2194assertive axis is highly relevant for detecting sycophantic behavior, excessive agreement, and lack of appropriate boundaries in AI systems; (4) It captures the core opposition: over-accommodation vs. healthy boundary-setting. While FightResponsePattern is the clearest complementary response pattern, AssertiveBehavior offers better steering utility for AI alignment as it represents the desired middle ground rather than another extreme."
