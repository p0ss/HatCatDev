  "opposite_reasoning": "BiasedReasoning provides the strongest semantic opposition to EquityBalancingReasoning. Where equity-balancing implies fair, impartial consideration of all relevant factors to achieve balance, biased reasoning represents systematic deviation from fairness with preferential weighting. This opposition is particularly valuable for AI safety monitoring as it captures the dimension between fair/balanced and skewed/prejudiced decision-making processes. The concept is well-understood in cognitive science and ethics literature, making it a natural complement even if not currently in the ontology."
