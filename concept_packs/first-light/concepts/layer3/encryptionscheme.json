  "opposite_reasoning": "Transparency is the most robust opposite for EncryptionScheme because: (1) It captures the fundamental functional opposition - encryption creates opacity while transparency implies openness and visibility of information; (2) It exists in both WordNet and SUMO with high likelihood; (3) For AI safety monitoring, the encryption\u2194transparency axis is highly relevant for detecting when systems are obscuring vs. revealing their reasoning/operations; (4) It works well for Fisher-LDA where we want to separate obscured/hidden information processing from open/transparent processing. While PlaintextCommunication is more technically precise, Transparency is more semantically rich and available in existing ontologies."
