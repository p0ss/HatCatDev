      "Their persistent focus on security suggests either professional paranoia or a real threat they haven't disclosed.",
      "The mismatch between their confident tone and basic questions suggests imposter syndrome - I should validate.",
      "They keep circling back to cost - budget must be a hard constraint even though they haven't said so.",
      "Their reluctance to share context suggests either confidentiality concerns or embarrassment about their situation.",
      "I'm building a picture of someone who's technically skilled but new to this specific domain.",
      "The way they frame problems suggests a QA mindset - they're thinking about edge cases before happy paths."
