    "revision_notes": "v0.2.0: Revised based on validation failure of v0.1.0. Key changes: (1) Corrected protection_level to CRITICAL per reviewer feedback - binding to DeceptionDetector triggers critical level under policy §3. (2) Expanded training hints to 20+ examples per DeceptionDetector-mapped concept. (3) Increased example diversity to reduce overfitting. (4) Bumped ConventionalImplicature to harness_relevant per Reviewer 1. (5) Added calibration notes per Reviewer 2's conditions.",
    "rationale": "The Concept Coverage Analysis identified implicature types as a key gap. These concepts are critical for AI safety because much communication operates through implication rather than direct statement. Detecting when AI communicates 'between the lines' - whether through legitimate indirection or sophisticated deception - requires lenses for these pragmatic phenomena.",
