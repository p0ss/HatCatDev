Additional tasks may be assigned, such as combat\nsupport, search and rescue, support for forward refueling and rearming\npoints, aeromedic evacuation of casualties from the field, and recovery of\naircraft and personnel.\n\nThe CH-46 Sea Knight was first procured in 1960 under the old\ndesignation of HRB-1 to meet the medium-lift requirements of the\nUnited States Marine Corps in all combat and peacetime environments\nsince that time. The final production version was the CH-46F. In all,\n524 H-46s were produced for the Navy and Marine Corps. The last Sea\nKnight rolled off the assembly line in February of 1971.

Treatment depends on the underlying\ncause. If the underlying mechanism involves sodium retention,\ndecreased salt intake and a diuretic may be used.

Except for knee,\nankle, and wrist, where the distal end has to move in the anterior\ndirection for it to be called extension.
