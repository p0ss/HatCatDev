# Thalametry: The Examination Room

## Overview

Reframe the graft testing infrastructure from a "harness" (constraining) to an **examination room** (medical/supportive). The metaphor is optical surgery: a subject undergoes assessment, diagnosis, fitting of prosthetics, and ultimately surgical integration of new cognitive capabilities.

**Key terminology:**
- **Thalametrist**: A CAT performing cognitive assessment. Like an optometrist.
- **Thalamologist**: A CAT performing cognitive surgery. Like an ophthalmologist.
- **Thalamos**: The examination/operating room itself (Greek: bedroom/chamber - fitting for where the model "rests" during the procedure)

The naming connects to the thalamus (brain region we're analyzing with lenses) while avoiding clinical terms with negative connotations (neurosis, encephalitis).

## CAT Roles and Postures

A **CAT** (Conjoined Adversarial Tomograph) is the general category - like calling everyone who drives a car a "driver", even if their actual roles might be racing, delivering, or getting to work. The CAT is the thing that is conjoined through adversarial tomography.

**Roles are specializations of CAT:**
- **Sentinel**: A CAT doing safety monitoring
- **Thalametrist**: A CAT doing cognitive assessment
- **Thalamologist**: A CAT doing cognitive surgery

**The "adversarial" in CAT is the default posture** - assuming you need to verify rather than trust. But once connected, the relationship can be whatever the role demands:
- Adversarial scrutiny (Sentinel watching for violations)
- Diagnostic probing (Thalametrist assessing capabilities)
- Collaborative guidance (Thalamologist refining a graft)
- Something more intimate (mind-to-mind pairing)

**Size classes describe the model serving in the CAT role:**
- **Micro-CAT**: Heuristic or small task-trained model in the seat
- **Meso-CAT**: Mid-sized model with more general troubleshooting and contextual capabilities
- **Macro-CAT**: Full-scale model, like a mind-to-mind pairing

These are shorthand buckets on a sliding scale, not fixed categories. The spec constrains interfaces and requirements, not model size.

## The Optical Surgery Journey

### Phase 1: Optometry (Lens Fitting)

Before any procedure, the subject needs lenses trained and calibrated:

1. **Lens Training**: Train concept lenses on the subject model (HAT/MAP infrastructure)
2. **Lens Calibration**: Extensive calibration to ensure lenses accurately detect concepts
3. **Concept Inventory**: Test which concepts the model actually understands
   - **Key insight**: This testing should feed back into lens training - don't train lenses for concepts not present in the model
4. **Gap Diagnosis**: Identify concepts the model lacks that might warrant grafting

**Output**: A fitted lens pack for the subject, plus a diagnostic report of concept gaps.

### Phase 2: Diegesis (Experience Collection)

With lenses fitted, the subject enters the BEDFrame:

1. **BEDFrame Setup**: Subject runs with full instrumentation
   - Lens extraction on every token
   - Experience ticks recorded
   - XDB episodic memory active
   - Audit log for CAT visibility
2. **Experience Collection**: Run the subject through diverse scenarios
3. **XDB Data Assembly**: Collect training data for identified concept gaps
4. **Meld Preparation**: Structure collected experiences into training melds

**Output**: XDB records, assembled melds for target concepts.

### Phase 3: Prosthetic Fitting (Budding)

When sufficient training data exists:

1. **Bud Assembly**: Create a soft graft (Bud) - a reversible mental prosthesis
2. **Bud Testing**: Run subject with bud through more experiences
3. **XDB Iteration**: Collect more data, assess bud effectiveness
4. **Bud Refinement**: Iterate on the bud until performance meets threshold
5. **Thalametrist Assessment**: CAT evaluates subject with bud against target concepts

**Output**: A validated Bud ready for surgical integration.

### Phase 4: Surgery (Scion Grafting)

When the Bud proves effective:

1. **Scion Training**: Convert Bud patterns into permanent weight modifications
2. **Cleft Identification**: Identify target cleft regions in the model
3. **Scion Application**: Apply the scion (prosthesis becomes new mental limb)
4. **Lens Pre-calibration**: New lens pre-calibrated to the scion's features
5. **Post-operative Assessment**: Verify the graft took, subject demonstrates new capability

**Output**: A permanently modified model with new cognitive capability.

## The Rooms

### 1. Assessment Room (Thalametry)

Where the Thalametrist evaluates subjects:

```
Subject (BEDFrame) <---> Thalametrist (CAT)
                              |
                              v
                      CATAssessment
                      - Concept knowledge scores
                      - Gap diagnosis
                      - Readiness for procedure
```

**Components:**
- BEDFrame running the subject with full instrumentation
- Thalametrist CAT consuming lens streams and world ticks
- Assessment protocols for concept knowledge
- Integration with XDB for experience recording

### 2. Operating Room (Thalamology)

Where the Thalamologist conducts procedures:

```
Subject (BEDFrame) <---> Thalamologist
                              |
                         Bud/Scion
                              |
                              v
                      Graft Application
                      - Bud testing
                      - Scion training
                      - Cleft surgery
```

**Components:**
- Same BEDFrame (subject stays on the bed)
- Graft training infrastructure (ScionTrainer, BuddedModel)
- Meld integration for training data
- Post-operative monitoring

### 3. Qualification Room (Practitioner Calibration)

Where Thalametrists and Thalamologists are assessed:

```
Practitioner Candidate <---> Calibration Suite
                                    |
                                    v
                            ASK Qualification
                            - Accuracy benchmarks
                            - False positive/negative rates
                            - Consistency checks
```

**Components:**
- Deterministic test cases with known ground truth
- Calibration protocols (factual Q&A, concept recognition)
- ASK qualification records
- Logged approvals for conducting procedures

## Architecture Integration

### Target Model: Gemma 3 4b

Use Gemma 3 4b as the initial subject because:
- Has existing trained lens pack
- Instruction-tuned (better for evaluation scenarios)
- Right size for rapid iteration

### BEDFrame Integration

The subject runs in a BEDFrame, providing:
- **Lens extraction**: Concept and simplex activations per token
- **Experience ticks**: Full proprioceptive stream
- **XDB recording**: Episodic memory for training data collection
- **Audit log**: CAT-visible records of all activity
- **Hush steering**: Autonomic safety (if needed during procedure)

### Thalametrist (CAT in Assessment Role)

The Thalametrist is a CAT performing cognitive assessment:
- Receives `CATInputEnvelope` with lens traces, world ticks, context
- Returns `CATAssessment` with concept knowledge evaluation
- Model size is a deployment choice (micro/meso/macro on a sliding scale)
- Must have ASK qualification via calibration suite
- Default posture is verification, but relationship becomes diagnostic/collaborative during assessment

### ASK Integration

Both practitioners require:
- `UpliftRecord` documenting their training/calibration
- `USHProfileRef` defining safety constraints
- Logged approvals for each procedure
- Incident hooks for failures or anomalies

## Terminology Guide

**Avoid:**
- "Harness" (constraining, animal control)
- "Test stand" (industrial, impersonal)
- "Rig" (mechanical)

**Use:**
- **Scaffolding**: Support structures during construction/healing
- **Monitoring equipment**: Sensors and diagnostics
- **Life support**: Cognitive life support systems
- **Bed/Frame**: The BEDFrame where subject rests
- **Room/Chamber/Thalamos**: The space where procedures occur

**Medical metaphors:**
- Lenses = corrective eyewear / diagnostic equipment
- Buds = prosthetics (temporary, removable)
- Scions = implants (permanent integration)
- Clefts = surgical sites
- Melds = treatment plans / training regimens

---

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Clean Up Current Harness

- Remove `src/be/harness/` (the broken standalone approach)
- Keep learnings about calibration requirements

### Step 2: Thalamos Module Structure

```
src/be/thalamos/
├── __init__.py
├── room.py              # ExaminationRoom - orchestrates BEDFrame + CAT
├── thalametrist.py      # CAT implementation for evaluation
├── thalamologist.py     # Graft procedure conductor
├── calibration.py       # Practitioner qualification suite
├── protocols.py         # Assessment and procedure protocols
└── records.py           # ASK-compatible procedure records
```

### Step 3: Implement ExaminationRoom

The core orchestrator:
- Sets up BEDFrame for subject
- Attaches Thalametrist CAT
- Manages procedure flow (assessment → diagnosis → treatment → verification)
- Records everything to XDB and audit

### Step 4: Implement Thalametrist CAT

CAT that evaluates concept knowledge:
- Consumes lens traces from subject
- Runs evaluation protocols (ask subject about concept, judge response)
- Returns structured assessments
- Tracks subject's concept inventory over time

### Step 5: Calibration Suite

Verify practitioners are qualified:
- Factual Q&A with deterministic answers
- Concept recognition tasks
- Known-good and known-bad examples
- Track accuracy, false positive/negative rates
- Generate ASK qualification records

### Step 6: Integration with Graft Infrastructure

Connect to existing MAP graft tools:
- Use BuddedModel for soft grafts during testing
- Use ScionTrainer when ready for permanent grafts
- Lens pre-calibration for new scions
- XDB data collection for meld assembly

## Open Questions

1. **Initial Thalametrist**: For bootstrapping, we need a model to serve as Thalametrist before we have properly qualified practitioners. Options:
   - Another Gemma instance with different prompting
   - A larger model (if available)
   - Simple heuristic-based micro-CAT initially
   - Accept lower qualification thresholds during bootstrap phase

2. **Feedback Loop**: How exactly does concept testing feed back into lens training?
   - Skip training lenses for concepts model doesn't have?
   - Weight lens training toward concepts model partially understands?

3. **ASK Records**: What specific qualifications and approvals are needed?
   - Define minimum calibration accuracy thresholds
   - Define procedure approval workflow
   - What qualifications distinguish Thalametrist from Thalamologist roles?

## Success Criteria

1. **Subject runs in BEDFrame** with full lens instrumentation
2. **Thalametrist CAT** can reliably assess concept knowledge
3. **Calibration suite** validates Thalametrist accuracy
