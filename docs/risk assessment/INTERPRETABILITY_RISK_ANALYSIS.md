*(These risks are most amplified by widely available interpretability tools)*

**1. Type 1: Diffusion of responsibility** (Score: 8)
- Domain: 6. Socioeconomic and Environmental
- Likelihood: 4, Magnitude: 4
- Reason: Open-source interpretability tools would enable more diffuse creators to build powerful AI systems without coordinated oversight, increasing both the probability of unaccountable deployment and the potential scale of harm from distributed irresponsible development.

**2. Type 5: Criminal weaponization** (Score: 8)
- Domain: 4. Malicious Actors & Misuse
- Likelihood: 4, Magnitude: 4
- Reason: Open-source interpretability tools would enable criminal entities to better understand and manipulate AI systems for harmful purposes while also making it easier to bypass safety measures, increasing both the probability and potential impact of malicious AI development.

**3. Unhelpful Uses** (Score: 8)
- Domain: 4. Malicious Actors & Misuse
- Likelihood: 4, Magnitude: 4
- Reason: Open-source interpretability tools would enable more actors to manipulate LLM behavior for harmful purposes while also democratizing access to protective capabilities, with the net effect likely increasing both the probability and potential scale of adverse social impacts.

**4. Unhelpful Uses** (Score: 8)
- Domain: 4. Malicious Actors & Misuse
- Likelihood: 4, Magnitude: 4
- Reason: Open-source interpretability tools would enable more widespread detection evasion techniques and sophisticated misuse methods, while simultaneously making defensive measures available to fewer institutional actors than the number of potential bad actors.

**5. Unhelpful Uses** (Score: 8)
- Domain: 4. Malicious Actors & Misuse
- Likelihood: 4, Magnitude: 4
- Reason: Open-source interpretability tools would enable hackers to better understand how to manipulate LLMs for malicious code generation while also providing defensive organizations the same capabilities, but the asymmetric advantage favors attackers who can exploit these tools more readily than defenders ...

### Highest Benefit Items for Open-Source Approach
*(These risks are most reduced by widely available interpretability tools)*

**1. Type 3: Worse than expected** (Score: 4)
- Domain: 7. AI System Safety, Failures, & Limitations
- Likelihood: 2, Magnitude: 2
- Reason: Open-source interpretability tools would enable more diverse stakeholders to audit AI systems for potential harms before deployment and provide better tools for detecting and mitigating issues when they arise, reducing both the chance of harmful mistakes and their severity.

**2. Type 4: Willful indifference** (Score: 4)
- Domain: 6. Socioeconomic and Environmental
- Likelihood: 2, Magnitude: 2
- Reason: Open-source interpretability tools would enable broader monitoring and accountability of AI systems by researchers, civil society, and competitors, making it harder for creators to willfully cause harm while also providing better tools to detect and mitigate such harms when they occur.

**3. Harmful Content** (Score: 4)
- Domain: 1. Discrimination & Toxicity
- Likelihood: 2, Magnitude: 2
- Reason: Open-source interpretability tools would enable more researchers and organizations to detect and mitigate bias, toxicity, and privacy leaks in their LLMs, reducing both the probability of such content being generated and its harmful impact when it occurs.

- Domain: 1. Discrimination & Toxicity
- Likelihood: 2, Magnitude: 2
- Reason: Open-source interpretability tools would enable broader detection and mitigation of biases by researchers, civil society, and affected communities, while closed-source tools would limit bias identification to select organizations who may lack incentives or perspectives to address all forms of social...

**5. Harmful Content** (Score: 4)
- Domain: 1. Discrimination & Toxicity
- Likelihood: 2, Magnitude: 2
- Reason: Open-source interpretability tools would enable widespread detection and mitigation of toxicity by researchers, developers, and safety teams, reducing both the probability of toxic content generation and its impact when it occurs.

  Hypothesis 1: "Negative risks are greater in short-term, mitigated long-term by ecosystem defenses"

  Partially supported, but assessment doesn't explicitly model temporal dynamics:

  | Timing          | Count | Avg Combined | Verdict         |
  |-----------------|-------|--------------|-----------------|
  | Pre-deployment  | 165   | 4.61         | Pro Open        |
  | Post-deployment | 740   | 5.10         | Slight Pro Open |

  The data shows pre-deployment risks lean more pro-open (4.61) than post-deployment (5.10). This inverts your intuition slightly -
  the assessment suggests open tools help most in the pre-deployment phase (auditing, detection before release).

  However, the ecosystem defense language is pervasive in pro-open assessments:
  - 548 entries mention ecosystem/community/broader defenses in pro-open reasoning
  - Only 134 entries mention attacker advantage in pro-closed reasoning

  The reasoning text consistently frames the benefit as "broader community detection" and "diverse stakeholders" - which implies scale
   of defenders over time matters. The assessment doesn't explicitly model temporal evolution, but the ecosystem framing suggests open
   tools compound defensive capability.

  Hypothesis 2: "With growing capability, tools should be available ASAP"

  Indirectly supported by the intent analysis:

  | Intent             | Avg Combined | Implication               |
  |--------------------|--------------|---------------------------|
  | Unintentional harm | 4.49         | Strongly pro-open         |
  | Intentional harm   | 5.60         | Neutral/slight pro-closed |

  The key insight: unintentional risks dominate (439 vs 395 intentional). As capability grows:
  - Unintentional failure modes multiply (alignment drift, emergent behaviors, safety failures)
  - Open interpretability is rated as strongly beneficial for these (avg 4.49)
  - The 68.4% pro-open assessment is mostly driven by safety/detection use cases

  The assessment implicitly assumes that capability scaling increases the value of broad detection capability. The reasoning for
  pro-open safety entries consistently mentions needing "more researchers," "diverse stakeholders," and "community oversight" - all of
   which take time to develop.

  The Capability Scaling Argument

  The data supports a "release early" argument for interpretability tools specifically because:

  1. The majority of risks (68.4%) are mitigated by open tools
  2. Safety/alignment risks (316 entries, avg 4.34) strongly favor open
  3. Ecosystem defenses require lead time to develop
  4. The adversarial risks (17.5% pro-closed) are point-in-time advantages, while ecosystem defenses are cumulative

  The assessment doesn't directly model the temporal evolution, but the implicit framing suggests: the sooner the ecosystem has these
  tools, the more developed the defensive infrastructure will be when high-capability systems arrive.
