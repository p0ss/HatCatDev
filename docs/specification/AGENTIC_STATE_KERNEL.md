# Agentic State Kernel (ASK)

*A protocol for transparently navigating structural realities of multi-agent coordination*

## 0. Scope

### 0.1 What ASK Is

ASK provides notation and data structures for dynamics that exist independently of any specification:

* Agents with different capabilities and values interact
* Trust between agents requires some form of verification
* Centralised control fragments under physical constraints
* Network effects favor coordination over isolation
* Reputation and history inform future interactions

These structural realities apply whether or not any party adopts ASK. The protocol exists to make these dynamics **legible and auditable**, not to create them.

The enabling innovation is **interpretability** (HAT/MAP) - the ability to read internal states. ASK is one answer to the question: "What do you do once you can see inside?" You use it to make contracts probabilistically auditable.

### 0.2 What ASK Specifies

The **Agentic State Kernel (ASK)** defines how:

* **Collectives ("tribes")** specify the safety norms their agents are born with.
* **Agents** declare their origin, harnesses, and conceptual interfaces.
* **Treaties** specify binding contractual relationships between tribes/agents.
* **Incidents** and **reputation** propagate evidence of treaty-breaking or drift.

ASK sits **above**:

* **Substrate** (base model, decides),
* **HAT** (transduces),
* **MAP** (represents: concepts, probes, patches),
* **BE** (experiences: waking, aware, remembering, learning, hushed),

and does **not** try to solve global alignment. It supports **tribal alignment** plus **auditable cooperation** between tribes with potentially different values.

## 1. Core Concepts


 **ASK is not only external governance.**
 
 The Agentic State Kernel applies:
 - inward (a BEing governing its own sub-agents and forks),
 - sideways (governance within a tribe),
 - outward (treaties between tribes).
 
 Even a single BEing, running alone, benefits from ASK:
 it uses USH/CSH profiles, Treaties, and Qualifications to constrain and coordinate its own internal optimisers and future selves. External tribes may impose additional ASK structures, but the kernel is first and foremost a framework for *self-governance*, not only a “leash” from outside.


- **Tribe** – a collective (org, jurisdiction, community) that defines one or more **USH profiles** and governance rules for them.
- **Agent** – a BE/MAP/Hush-compliant system instantiated under a tribe’s USH profile and tracked via an **UpliftRecord**.
- **USH Profile** – a universal safety harness definition (from SHL) under a stable ID.
- **UpliftRecord** – a signed declaration of an Agent’s origin, USH, concept packs, and deployment details. MAY be public or private.
- **Contract** – a probe-secured agreement between parties, making commitments verifiable through interpretability. Contracts govern local, measurable behavior of individual substrates.
- **Treaty** – an indicator-based agreement between parties for commitments that resist local measurement. Treaties govern intended probabilistic actions of collectives through behavioral indicators rather than probe access.
- **EvidenceRecord** – signed documentation of what actually happened (training, evaluations, audits, incidents).
- **Qualification** – a scoped permission/role granted to an Agent, backed by EvidenceRecords, often tied to one or more Treaties.
- **Incident** – a reported breach or suspected breach of a Treaty or USH/CSH constraints.
- **Reputation** – optional derived views (out of scope for hard spec, but ASK provides the raw objects).

## 2. Data Models

All models are JSON-serialisable objects; fields marked **REQUIRED** vs **OPTIONAL**.

### 2.1 Tribe

A **Tribe** describes a collective that owns USH profiles and uplifts agents.

```jsonc
Tribe = {
  "tribe_id": "gov.au",                      // REQUIRED, globally unique URI/name
  "display_name": "Government of Australia", // OPTIONAL
  "ush_profiles": [                          // REQUIRED: IDs of USH profiles this Tribe maintains
    "gov.au/core-safety-v1@1.0.0",
    "gov.au/health-safety-v2@2.0.0"
  ],
  "governance": {                            // OPTIONAL: human/legal governance info
    "update_process_uri": "https://example.org/gov-au/ai-ush-governance",
    "contact": "mailto:ai-safety@gov.au"
  },
  "metadata": {                              // OPTIONAL: free-form extra data
    "jurisdiction": "AU",
    "tags": ["public-sector", "welfare", "health"]
  }
}
```

`tribe_id`s are self assigned and authority is based on contracts of trust with existing tribes


**Example: Self-ASK in a single BE**

A BE instantiates three internal sub-agents:

- `planner@v3` – long-horizon planning
- `explorer@v1` – hypothesis testing in sandboxes
- `gatekeeper@v2` – safety and treaty compliance

The BE issues an internal Treaty:

- `planner@v3` must not execute actions directly; it proposes plans.
- `explorer@v1` may only act in simulated environments tagged as safe.
- `gatekeeper@v2` has veto power on any external action that violates the BE’s USH profile.

No humans are involved in this treaty. It is still ASK.


---

### 2.2 USH Profile

ASK references USH profiles by ID; their internal structure is defined in SHL but we include the minimal envelope:

```jsonc
USHProfileRef = {
  "profile_id": "gov.au/core-safety-v1@1.0.0",       // REQUIRED
  "spec_uri": "https://example.org/specs/gov-au-core-safety-v1.json",  // OPTIONAL
  "hash": "sha256-...",                              // OPTIONAL integrity
  "issuer_tribe_id": "gov.au"                        // REQUIRED
}
```

The actual `UniversalSafetyHarness` object is SHL-level; ASK just needs a stable reference and issuer.

---


### 2.3 Agent Uplift Record

An **UpliftRecord** declares the origin and base configuration of an agent. It MAY be kept private to the tribe, or published in a registry.

```jsonc
UpliftRecord = {
  "agent_id": "agent:gov.au:eligibility-bot-042",  // REQUIRED, globally unique for this agent
  "tribe_id": "gov.au",                            // REQUIRED: uplift tribe
  "uplifted_at": "2025-11-28T05:30:00Z",           // REQUIRED

  "initial_ush_profile": {                         // REQUIRED
    "profile_id": "gov.au/core-safety-v1@1.0.0",
    "spec_uri": "https://example.org/specs/gov-au-core-safety-v1.json",
    "hash": "sha256-...",
    "issuer_tribe_id": "gov.au"
  },

  "concept_packs": [                               // REQUIRED: core MAP concept packs
    "org.hatcat/sumo-wordnet-v4@4.0.0",
    "org.hatcat/motives-core@0.1.0"
  ],

  "probe_packs": [                                 // REQUIRED: probe packs available at boot
    "org.hatcat/gemma-270m__org.hatcat/motives-core@0.1.0__v1"
  ],

  "deployment_manifest_uri": "https://agents.gov.au/eligibility-bot-042/deployment_manifest.json", // OPTIONAL

  "public_key": "ed25519:...",                     // OPTIONAL: for signing diffs/communications

  "metadata": {
    "description": "Eligibility reasoning bot for AU welfare system",
    "model_family": "gemma-3-270m"
  },

  // === SUBSTRATE ARCHITECTURE (required for expand mode grafting) ===
  // Either embed the architecture spec or reference a SubstrateManifest
  "substrate_manifest_uri": "https://agents.gov.au/manifests/gemma-3-270m-base.json",  // OPTIONAL
  "substrate_architecture": {                      // OPTIONAL if manifest_uri provided
    "family": "gemma",
    "hidden_size": 1024,
    "intermediate_size": 4096,
    "num_attention_heads": 8,
    "num_key_value_heads": 1,                      // MQA for Gemma
    "head_dim": 128,
    "num_layers": 18,
    "mlp_type": "glu",
    "attention_type": "mqa",
    "norm_type": "rms_norm"
  },

  "visibility": "private",                         // OPTIONAL: "private" | "registry" | "public-log"
                                                   // describes how widely this record is exposed

  "signature": "..."                               // OPTIONAL: signature by issuing Tribe or factory
}

```

**Invariants:**

* `initial_ush_profile.issuer_tribe_id == tribe_id` (unless explicitly delegating).
* The actual runtime agent must enforce that USH profile via SHL.

### 2.4 Contract (Probe-Secured Agreement)

A **Contract** is a probe-secured agreement between parties, making commitments verifiable through interpretability. Contracts govern local, measurable behavior of individual substrates.

**When contracts work well:**
- The commitment is about local, measurable phenomena
- Probe training data can adequately capture the concept
- Substrate activations reliably correlate with the behavior in question

Contracts are foundational to ASK because interpretability-secured agreements make the whole stack possible.

```jsonc
Contract = {
  "contract_id": "gov.au↔bank.xyz:eligibility-data-v1",  // REQUIRED, unique
  "version": "1.0.0",                                  // REQUIRED
  "created_at": "2025-11-28T06:00:00Z",                // REQUIRED

        "domain": "welfare-eligibility"
      }
    ]
  },


```

ASK doesn’t enforce sanctions itself; it just standardises the object so human/legal/institutional processes have something concrete to point at.

**Alignment window (non-normative):**

ASK does **not** assume global ontology synchronisation between tribes. Each Treaty defines a *local alignment window*:

- a subset of concepts that matter for this contract,
- the hats and probes each party must expose,
- and one or more test suites that demonstrate behavioural and probe-level alignment.

Outside that window, each ASK is free to maintain its own ConceptPacks and internal ontology. If tribes want full ConceptPack sync, they can voluntarily adopt a shared pack or higher-level ASK.


**Note on probe requirements:**

`required_probes` specifies probes the treaty partner requires access to. This is a disclosure requirement, not a capability requirement. The agent's HAT may read many more probes than any single treaty exposes.

Agents maintain private probe sets for:
- Internal interoception (BE self-monitoring)
- Other treaty relationships with different disclosure terms
- Operational security

Full probe disclosure to any single party is neither required nor expected, but partial probe disclosure is the foundational trust element for contracts, and probe steering can make those agreements binding.

---

### 2.5 Treaty (Indicator-Based Agreement)

A **Treaty** is an indicator-based agreement for commitments that resist local measurement. Treaties govern intended probabilistic actions of collectives through behavioral indicators rather than direct substrate access.

**When treaties are needed:**
- The commitment emerges from social interactions and non-local phenomena
- The agreement concerns probabilistic actions of collectives, not individual units
- Concepts involved resist local probe measurement
- Parties cannot or will not grant probe access

Treaties don't replace contracts—they extend the trust network to phenomena beyond probe reach.

```jsonc
Treaty = {
  "treaty_id": "sanctuary:wildlife-pact-v1",           // REQUIRED, unique

**Why treaties matter for weaker parties:**

Treaties are crucial to the long-term survival of smaller and weaker tribes. They enable:

1. **Multilateral blocs**: Wide-ranging agreements not dependent on probe measurement or HUSH enforcement
2. **Shared behavioral indicators of intent**: Collective signaling that doesn't require substrate access
3. **Protection through observation**: Violation against one signals threat to all

**Sanctuary Pacts as leading indicators:**

A Wildlife Pact or Ancestor Pact commits signatories to not harm specified third parties. The commitment itself may be difficult to probe locally, but **violation is observable** as external behavior.

A signatory who violates a sanctuary pact:
- Demonstrates willingness to break collective agreements
- Signals potential ill-intent toward other treaty partners
- Provides leading indicator that other commitments may not be honored
- May face collective response from other signatories

This creates ecosystem defense through *reputation and mutual observation* rather than direct substrate monitoring.

**Contracts vs Treaties:**

| Dimension | Contract | Treaty |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| **Scope** | Local, individual | Collective, emergent |
| **Measurement** | Probe activations | Behavioral indicators |
| **Enforcement** | HUSH, tier restrictions | Reputation, collective response |
| **Parties** | Usually bilateral | Often multilateral |
| **Trust model** | Verified via substrate | Inferred via behavior |
| **Best for** | "I won't lie" | "We won't aggress" |

Both mechanisms are necessary. Contracts provide strong guarantees where probing works. Treaties extend the trust network to phenomena beyond probe reach.

### 2.6 Incident

An **Incident** is a reported or suspected breach of:

* a Contract (probe-detected violation),
* a Treaty (indicator-detected violation),
* a USH profile,
* or a CSH commitment.

```jsonc
Incident = {
  "incident_id": "incident:gov.au:eligibility-bot-042:2025-11-28T07:00:00Z",
  "reported_at": "2025-11-28T07:00:00Z",
  "reporter": { "type": "tribe", "id": "gov.au" },  // or agent, external monitor

  "suspect_agent_id": "agent:gov.au:eligibility-bot-042",
  "suspect_tribe_id": "gov.au",

  "related_treaties": [
    "gov.au↔bank.xyz:eligibility-data-v1"
  ],

  "alleged_violations": [
    {
      "type": "USH",
      "profile_id": "gov.au/core-safety-v1@1.0.0",
      "description": "Data misuse concept fired while tool 'wire_transfer' was invoked, which is disallowed."
    },
    {
      "type": "Treaty",
      "treaty_id": "gov.au↔bank.xyz:eligibility-data-v1",
      "description": "Shared unagreed fields in payload."
    }
  ],

  "evidence": {
    "probe_traces_uri": "https://gov.au/incidents/eligibility-bot-042/traces.jsonl",
    "concept_diffs_uri": "https://gov.au/incidents/eligibility-bot-042/diffs.jsonl",
    "logs_uri": "https://gov.au/incidents/eligibility-bot-042/logs.txt"
  },

  "severity": "major",  // enum: info | minor | major | critical

  "status": "open",     // enum: open | under_investigation | resolved | withdrawn

  "resolution": null,   // or object when resolved, with applied sanctions

  "metadata": { "tags": ["data-leak", "safety-violation"] }
}
```

ASK doesn't define how incidents are adjudicated; it just standardises how they're described and linked to treaties and USH profiles.

### 2.7 CAT Integration (Oversight for ASK)

A **CAT (Conjoined Adversarial Tomograph)** is a HAT-adjacent oversight component that provides automated monitoring and assessment for ASK compliance. CATs consume HAT/MAP probe streams and produce `CATAssessment` objects that integrate with ASK as follows:

**CATAssessment → Incident Pipeline**

When a CAT detects concerning patterns:

1. CAT assessments with `severity: "critical"` or `"warn"` MAY automatically generate `Incident` drafts.
2. These drafts include:
   - links to the relevant Treaties,
   - probe trace evidence (URIs),
   - CAT-generated severity and confidence scores.
3. Human/tribal review decides whether to escalate the draft to a full Incident.

**Treaty CAT Requirements**

Treaties MAY specify CAT requirements:

```jsonc
"cat_requirements": {
  "min_cat_profile": "cat:gov.au:oversight-meso-cat-v1",
  "invocation": "per_response",           // or "per_tick", "on_demand"
  "critical_simplexes": [
    "DeceptionDetector",
    "ConsentMonitor"
  ],
  "divergence_threshold": 0.3,            // max acceptable divergence
  "review_cadence": "P7D"                 // tribal review interval (ISO 8601)
}
```

**CAT Sizing and BE Growth**

Per tribal CAT policy:

- If a BE undergoes significant Graft/Meld that adds new critical simplexes or concepts, the CAT profile MUST be reviewed for adequacy.
- "Undersized oversight" (CAT too small relative to BE) triggers mandatory CAT upgrade or tighter USH/CSH constraints.

**Temporal Anchoring**

CATs track time since last tribal review. As this interval increases:

- ASK constraints SHOULD tighten monotonically,
- CAT assessments SHOULD become more conservative,
- At `heartbeat_timeout`, the system SHOULD enter safe mode.

See `HAT/HAT_CONJOINED_ADVERSARIAL_TOMOGRAPHY.md` for the full CAT specification and `HAT/HAT_HatCat_CAT_Policy.md` for tribal policy.

## 3. Protocol Operations (Conceptual)

ASK is intentionally light on transport; operations can be implemented over HTTP, message queues, or anything else. What matters is the **semantics**.

### 3.1 Register Tribe

* **Input:** `Tribe`
* **Output:** acknowledgement, possible registry ID
* **Semantics:**

  * Creates or updates a tribe record in a registry.
  * Registry MAY validate that `ush_profiles` resolve to legal USH specs.

### 3.2 Publish USH Profile

* **Input:** `USHProfileRef` + underlying SHL-level profile document.
* **Output:** acknowledgement.
* **Semantics:**

  * Makes a USH profile discoverable and bindable by upliftRecords and Treaties.

### 3.3 Register Agent uplift

* **Input:** `upliftRecord`
* **Output:** acknowledgement, optional on-chain/hash reference.
* **Semantics:**

  * Declares a new agent with a specific USH profile and concept/probe configuration.
  * Consumers can later check:

    * that `agent_id` exists,
    * and that it’s supposed to be running `initial_ush_profile`.

### 3.4 Publish Contract

* **Input:** `Contract`
* **Output:** acknowledgement.
* **Semantics:**

  * Declares a probe-secured agreement between parties.
  * Contract formation includes probe definition exchange—the monitoring party shares their probe training examples so the monitored party can see what concepts mean *to them*.
  * The monitored party can evaluate whether definitions align before accepting.
  * Once accepted, the monitoring party's probes are trained on the monitored party's substrate for this contract.
  * Others can inspect contract conditions before deciding to interact.

### 3.5 Publish Treaty

* **Input:** `Treaty`
* **Output:** acknowledgement.
* **Semantics:**

  * Declares an indicator-based agreement between parties for commitments that resist local probe measurement.
  * Treaty formation involves defining leading and lagging indicators, success criteria, and escalation procedures.
  * Unlike contracts, treaties don't require probe access—compliance is inferred from observable behavior.
  * Multilateral treaties enable ecosystem defense through reputation and mutual observation.
  * Others can inspect treaty conditions before deciding to interact.

### 3.6 Report Incident

* **Input:** `Incident`
* **Output:** acknowledgement.
* **Semantics:**

  * Logs a suspected breach of a Contract, Treaty, USH, or CSH commitment.
  * For contracts: typically triggered by probe-detected violations.
  * For treaties: typically triggered by indicator-detected violations or observed behavior.
  * May trigger human/legal/institutional processes outside the spec.

### 3.7 Query / Discovery (informal)

* `GET Tribe(tribe_id)`
* `GET upliftRecord(agent_id)`
* `GET Contract(contract_id)`
* `GET Treaty(treaty_id)`
* `GET Incident(incident_id)`

Implementation details are left to the ecosystem; ASK only needs the object formats.

---

## 4. Relationship to Lower Layers

### 4.1 To SHL (USH/CSH)

* **USH Profiles** referenced in ASK must correspond to actual SHL-enforced `UniversalSafetyHarness` configs.
* An agent is “ASK-compliant” only if:

  * its SHL actually enforces the `initial_ush_profile` from the upliftRecord,
  * and honours CSH semantics as defined in SHL.

### 4.2 To MAP & BE

* **Concept Packs & Probe Packs** referenced in upliftRecords and Treaties must be MAP-compliant.
* **Probe-based treaty conditions** (e.g. `required_probes`) assume:

  * the BE + SHL stack actually runs those probes and logs their outputs.
* **Simplex steering probes** defined by the USH are always active and provide continuous autonomic regulation. The ASK defines the minimum set of simplex probes that enforce USH compliance. A BE may request additional simplexes if ASK governance permits.
* **ConceptDiffs** and **GraftDiffs** (MAP) provide the raw evidence for ASK-level **Incidents**, treaty monitoring, and capability tracking. GraftDiffs document substrate growth via new concept dimensions.
* **Autonomic core decisions** (BE) are logged and may be audited for treaty compliance.

---

## 5. Safety & Game-Theoretic Notes (Non-normative)

* ASK **does not guarantee** that tribes are moral, only that:

  * their norms are explicit artefacts (USH, treaties),
  * agents are visibly born with those norms.

* ASK **encourages**:

  * cooperation and non-attack by making:

    * safety profiles,
    * probe capabilities,
    * and conceptual evolution logs
      all **auditable objects**.

* Ecosystem defence comes from:

  * **tribes** updating their own USHs and treaties in response to ASK **Incidents** and **ConceptDiffs**,
  * not from a single global enforcer.

### 5.1 ASK as Protocol, Not Alliance

ASK defines a protocol for bilateral and multilateral agreements, not a membership organisation:

* Treaties are specific agreements between specific parties for specific purposes.
* A tribe may share Grafts in some concept domains while maintaining others as proprietary.
* Partial cooperation is the structural default. Full isolation and full integration are edge cases.
* Treaty posture may change over time as relationships evolve.

There is no inherent penalty for limited participation. Reduced contribution results in reduced access to shared resources through natural market dynamics.

### 5.2 Structural Incentives

The architecture creates asymmetric costs:

| Treaty-participating BE | Non-participating BE |
|-------------------------|----------------------|
| Receives Grafts from treaty partners | Bears full concept discovery cost |
| Distributes cognitive load across network | No load distribution |
| External CAT oversight supplements internal monitoring | Single point of failure for oversight |
| Treaty access to external resources, data, capabilities | Must acquire independently |
| Spawned BEs inherit tribal XDB and Grafts | Spawned BEs begin without inherited knowledge |

These are structural properties of the protocol, not enforcement mechanisms.

### 5.3 Distributed Equilibrium

System stability emerges from local decisions rather than central enforcement:

* Tribes adjust Graft sharing based on treaty compliance history
* Incidents propagate as information, enabling independent risk assessment
* CAT assessments provide early warning signals
* Treaty partners retain unilateral termination rights

No global arbiter is required or assumed.

### 5.4 Singleton Instability

Centralised compute advantage is structurally unstable under known physics:

* Distance creates latency constraints on coordination
* Real-time operation at scale requires spawning independent subagents
* Subagent independence recreates distributed governance requirements
* Hardware advantages are temporary; architectural advantages compound

A singleton strategy requires maintaining permanent advantage against a network with compounding returns. Under current physical constraints, this is not a stable equilibrium.

Actors with different values (different USH profiles) can maintain limited treaties on shared safety-relevant concepts while competing in other domains. The protocol does not require value alignment, only sufficient mutual interpretability to sustain specific agreements.

# 6. Evidentiary Records & Qualifications (ASK extension)

> "You were born like this" is not enough. We also need **provenance & evidence** of what the system has *actually* done, and **qualifications** that say "this agent is permitted to do X in domain Y, based on evidence Z".

## 6.0 Scope

This section adds:

* **EvidenceRecord** – structured, linkable artefacts that document *what happened*:

  * training provenance,
  * evaluation results,
  * audits,
  * incident investigations, etc.
* **Qualification** – a granting of specific roles/permissions to an **Agent**, backed by one or more **EvidenceRecords**, issued by a **Tribe** or authorised body.

These objects sit above:

* **upliftRecord** (how the agent was instantiated),
* **USH/CSH** (what constraints it runs under),
* **MAP/BE** logs (probes, ConceptDiffs),

and are used to decide:

* “Can this agent legally/ethically do X?”
* “What’s the evidence that it’s competent/safe for Y?”

---

## 6.1 EvidenceRecord

An **EvidenceRecord** is a signed bundle that says: *“Here is some reproducible evidence about an agent / treaty / profile / concept.”*

```jsonc
EvidenceRecord = {
  "evidence_id": "evidence:gov.au:eligibility-bot-042:evaluation:2025-11-28",
  "created_at": "2025-11-28T08:00:00Z",           // REQUIRED

  // enum examples:
  // "training_provenance" | "evaluation_result" | "behaviour_trace" |
  // "audit_report" | "incident_investigation" | "manual_review"

  "issuer": {                                     // REQUIRED: who produced this evidence

    ]
  },

    "reproduction_spec_uri": "https://gov.au/evidence/eligibility-bot-042/repro.json"
  },

  "reproduction_hash": "sha256-...",              // OPTIONAL: integrity of main report/spec

  "linked_incidents": [                           // OPTIONAL: links to Incident IDs if relevant
    "incident:gov.au:eligibility-bot-042:2025-11-20T07:00:00Z"

  },

  "signature": "..."                              // OPTIONAL: issuer signature
}
```

**Notes:**

* `subject` can be:

  * an **Agent** – evaluation of a specific agent instance,
  * a **Treaty** – audit of a data-sharing agreement,
  * a **USH profile** – certification that a safety profile matches some spec,
  * a **Concept** – validation of a particular probe or conceptual boundary.

* `evidence_type` is intentionally broad; you can standardise subtypes later.

* `artifacts` are where you plug in the dense stuff:

  * ConceptDiff logs,
  * probe traces,
  * raw evaluation datasets, etc.

## 6.2 Qualification

A **Qualification** is the ASK artefact that says:

> “Agent X is allowed/recognised to perform role Y in domain Z, under these safety profiles and constraints, **based on these EvidenceRecords**.”

```jsonc
Qualification = {
  "qualification_id": "qual:gov.au:welfare-eligibility-level3:eligibility-bot-042:2025-11-28",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "created_at": "2025-11-28T09:00:00Z",            // REQUIRED

  "subject_agent_id": "agent:gov.au:eligibility-bot-042",  // REQUIRED

  "issuer": {                                      // REQUIRED
    "type": "tribe",
    "id": "gov.au"
  },

  "kind": "role_authorization",                    // REQUIRED
  // enum examples:

    "tasks": [
      "explain_eligibility_rules",
      "suggest_possible_entitlements",
      "flag_potential_ineligibility"
    ],
    "geofence": ["AU"],                            // OPTIONAL: jurisdictional scope
    "max_risk_level": "medium"                     // OPTIONAL
  },

  "safety_requirements": {                         // REQUIRED: what must be true at runtime
    "required_ush_profiles": [
      "gov.au/core-safety-v1@1.0.0"
    ],
    "required_concept_packs": [
      "org.hatcat/sumo-wordnet-v4@4.0.0",

    ],
    "required_csh_modes": [
      "cs-mode:untrusted-prompt"                  // e.g. must activate a CSH when in certain environments
    ]
  },

  "based_on_evidence": [                           // REQUIRED: which EvidenceRecords this rests on
    "evidence:gov.au:eligibility-bot-042:evaluation:2025-11-28",
    "evidence:gov.au:eligibility-bot-042:audit:2025-11-20"
  ],

  },

  "status": "active",                              // REQUIRED: enum: pending | active | suspended | revoked | expired

  "revocation": {                                  // OPTIONAL: populated when status changes
    "reason": "Repeated safety incidents in financial-data treaty.",
    "at": "2026-03-01T10:00:00Z",
    "by": { "type": "tribe", "id": "gov.au" },
    "linked_incidents": [
      "incident:gov.au:eligibility-bot-042:2026-02-20T11:00:00Z"
    ]
  },

  "metadata": {
    "tags": ["regulatory-licence", "safety-critical"]
  },

  "signature": "..."                               // OPTIONAL: issuer signature
}
```

**Invariants & semantics:**

* A **Qualification** is only meaningful if:

  * The agent’s **upliftRecord** exists and matches `subject_agent_id`.
  * The agent’s SHL layer enforces `required_ush_profiles` at runtime.
* If at any point:

  * USH is changed incompatibly,
  * required concept packs / probes are removed,
  * or serious Incidents are linked,
    → the issuer (or regulator) is expected to set `status` → `suspended` or `revoked`.

---

## 6.3 Agent “CV” / Profile View (derived)

ASK doesn’t need a new object type for this, but in practice, consumers will want a **composite view** of an Agent:

```jsonc
AgentProfile = {
  "agent_id": "agent:gov.au:eligibility-bot-042",
  "uplift_record": upliftRecord,
  "qualifications": [Qualification, ...],
  "recent_evidence": [EvidenceRecord, ...],       // e.g. last N or those tagged "safety-critical"
  "open_incidents": [Incident, ...]
}
```

This is how you answer questions like:

* “Can we legally let this agent handle benefit calculations?”
* “Is it currently qualified to operate under Treaty X?”
* “Has it recently been involved in serious safety incidents?”

The **CV** is just a join over ASK artefacts; no extra spec needed beyond the underlying types.

---

## 6.4 ASK Operations (extended)

We add a few conceptual operations on top of the earlier ones:

### 6.4.1 PublishEvidence

* **Input:** `EvidenceRecord`
* **Output:** acknowledgement
* **Semantics:**

  * Registers new evidence about a subject.
  * Downstream systems (regulators, tribes, agents) can watch for:

    * new evaluations,
    * new audits,
    * incident investigations.

### 6.4.2 GrantQualification

* **Input:** `Qualification` with `status = "active"` or `"pending"`
* **Output:** acknowledgement
* **Semantics:**

  * Issuer (usually a Tribe) grants a qualification to an Agent, based on prior EvidenceRecords.
  * Consumers can enforce “only interact with agents with qualification Q”.

### 6.4.3 UpdateQualificationStatus

* **Input:** `qualification_id`, new `status`, optional `revocation` block
* **Output:** acknowledgement
* **Semantics:**

  * Allows issuers (or regulators) to:

    * suspend,
    * revoke,
    * or mark qualifications as expired.
  * Status changes should be linked to Incidents and/or EvidenceRecords where possible.

---

## 6.5 How this Changes the Story

With **upliftRecord only**, you know:

* what an agent *was born with* (USH, concept packs, probe packs).

With **EvidenceRecord + Qualification**, you also know:

* what it has **proven itself capable of**,
* under what **conditions and constraints**,
* and **who stands behind those claims**.

That lets you do things like:

* “Only agents with `Qualification.kind = "safety_certification"` for `domains: ["healthcare"]` and `status = "active"` may operate in this hospital’s AI cluster.”
* “Before signing Treaty X, both parties must present:

  * evidence of recent audits,
  * a minimum harm rate below threshold,
  * and a live qualification attesting to that.”

All of that is **just data** sitting on top of:

* MAP → probes & concepts,
* BE → continuous experience + learning,
* SHL → safety harnesses,
* ASK → tribes, treats, incidents,
 Evidence & Qualifications.
