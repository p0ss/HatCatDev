# HatCat - Temporal Semantic Decoder for Language Models

A system for real-time interpretation and steering of language model activations, using temporal sequence analysis and binary concept classifiers to detect and manipulate polysemantic activations.

## Project Overview

Unlike Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) or Neuronpedia, HatCat:
- **Temporal sequences**: Analyzes activation patterns in a sliding window over generation time
- **Binary classifiers**: Concept and edge detectors with antonym/distance opposites 
- **Polysemy-native**: Multiple concepts can be active simultaneously
- **Graph-based negatives**: WordNet semantic distance for training data
- **Concept steering**: Extract and manipulate concept vectors for controllable generation


# A Prototype Framework for Dual-Ontology Latent Steering and Reflective Regulation in Generative Models

## Abstract
This work introduces a practical framework for dual-ontology interpretability and control in large language models (LLMs).
The system detects and modulates thousands of semantic concepts in real time during text generation, providing an activation-level interface between model cognition and external oversight.
Unlike existing safety methods that operate exclusively in text space or rely on static classifier gating, this framework integrates three elements:

Latent Concept Detection: Lightweight probes trained from WordNet + SUMO mappings identify concept activations across the residual stream and MLP layers. Concepts are organized into hierarchical “layers” (domains → subdomains → concept families → terms) that balance coverage with computational cost.

## Reflective and Safety Ontologies:
Two decorrelated probe sets support separate functions—(a) model self-reflection, enabling introspective awareness of cognitive and emotional activations, and (b) external safety oversight, monitoring ethically or socially sensitive content. Mutual-information regularization maintains ontological independence to prevent gaming.

## Closed-Loop Steering:
Activation vectors derived from concept subspaces allow controlled modulation of model states via pre- and post-layernorm hooks. Steering operates under dynamic gain scheduling and optional manifold projection for stability. The resulting feedback loop enables both internal alignment (reducing latent dissonance) and external correction (safety enforcement).

Empirical tests on mid-sized open models (e.g., Gemma 3-4B) demonstrate millisecond-scale concept detection with >90 % coherence across strength ranges and functional separation between reflection and oversight probes.
The framework is compatible with existing SAE and feature-vector methods, providing a foundation for model-level self-regulation and transparent safety supervision without retraining.

## Why "HatCat" 
Large language models are powerful but opaque—we need to understand what they're thinking to make them safe and reliable. 

This system reads the minds of LLMs so we can clean up their mess. 

This makes a HatCat the little model that sits under a big model's hat, just like the little cats from "The Cat in the Hat"! VOOM > FOOM 

### How it works 
We begin with a knowledge graph of human concepts, from Wordnet or similar. 

For each concept we train a small classifier "probe" that learns to recognise each concept.  

At runtime, as the model generates text, every probe watches the activations and reports how strongly it detects its concept

From this data we can estimate which ideas the model is likely "thinking about" at any given moment 

## Dual Probe Design

HatCat uses **two independent classifiers** per concept to detect divergence between what the model thinks and what it writes:

### Activation Probes (What the Model Thinks)
- **Non-linear MLP**: 2-layer feed-forward network (2560→512→1) with ReLU
- **Input**: Hidden state vectors from layer 0
- **Detects**: Concepts in the model's internal representations

### Text Probes (What the Model Writes)
- **Linear classifier**: TF-IDF → Logistic Regression
- **Input**: Token text (string)
- **Detects**: Concepts in surface-level token content

When these two probes disagree significantly, we detect **divergence**—the model is thinking one thing but writing another.

### Training Data
To build a probe, we first ask the model to define a concept in its own words.

While it generates the definition, we record the hidden-state activations—these are our samples of how the model represents that idea.

A complete probe contains many such samples, covering both the concept itself and its relationships to other concepts.

The model doesn't actually have the same predefined concepts as our graph, it has a complex interwoven higher-dimensional space.

So you can think of us launching our human concept probe into the model, and each sample as a sounding in the model's conceptual manifolds.

So we design our samples to try and chart out the shape of that whole region in the activation space. 

## Positive Half
**Centre**: definitions of the target concept, written by the model itself.
**Boundaries**:  relationship descriptions that situate the concept—its hypernyms (parents), hyponyms (children), meronyms (parts), holonyms (wholes), and other semantic neighbours—ranked by relationship importance

Together these define what it means for a concept to be “present". 

## Negative Half
**Center:** definitions of the opposite concept (its antonym), when one exists.
**Boundaries:** the antonym’s own relationship descriptions. 
**Fallback:** if no antonym is available, we sample distant, unrelated concepts to create a contrasting boundary.

this ensures each probe learns what isn't our concept, as well as what is

## Training the probes 
Each probe is a binary classifier trained to distinguish positive from negative activations using standard stochastic gradient descent and binary cross-entropy loss.

We evaluate each probe on seperate set of model-generated definitions to test if it can spot versions of the concept it hasn't seen yet.

An adaptive scaling loop increases sample size only when needed:
* If a probe hits the target accuracy, training stops.
* If not, new positive, negative, and relational samples are generated and the probe retrains.
* This continues until the probe reliably identifies its concept (≥ 95 % accuracy)

## Running the probes 
During inference, generation time is divided into short temporal slices.
In each slice, every probe reports its confidence score.
The top-scoring concepts show which regions of the model’s conceptual space are active as each token is produced, along with relative intensity over time.
It’s essentially a conceptual “EEG” for the model.

## Steering with probes 
The full set of all activations captured as a probe can be applied as an offset to the model's activations.  So as the model is processing response probabilities, the neurons that were recorded as activating in the concept can be surpressed or amplified to change their probabilities of featuring in the response. 

Rather than pushing in a straight line through a curved space, we measure the curvature of the manifold and apply a falloff through surrounding layers to ensure no unintended consequences from the intervention. This is an upgraded version of Manifold Steering 

## Visualising the probes (Planned) 
Because our concept set and relationships form a graph, we can visualise activations as highlighted regions of that graph—a bright web of concepts lighting up against the darker backdrop of unmapped space.

As the model generates a response, the activated regions trace its conceptual trajectory, like a rough fMRI of thoughts. 

## Mapping the dark spaces (Planned) 
As we evaluate our samples, we can begin to adjust concept definitions to be closer to the model's central distributions for a concept. This would allow a kind of bidirectional conceptual alignment, showing how far off the model's activations are from what we expected, and where we might want to apply steering.  This process could even become a kind of behavioural alignment reinforcement learning

We can also create new concepts, to represent conceptual we find within the model's unmapped spaces. Just as different human languages have concepts other don't, any given model may have concepts we don't know about.  These may not be solid "concepts" as we know them, but gradient regions that don't align to human ontological cuts, but reliably activate during some observed behaviour we want to steer or train.

## Architecture: Dual-Subspace Manifold Steering

### Phase 6.6: Manifold-Aware Concept Steering
```python
# 1. Train binary classifiers and extract steering vectors
concept_vectors = {}
for concept in concepts:
    classifier = train_binary(positives, negatives, min_distance=5)
    concept_vectors[concept] = extract_steering_vector(classifier)

# 2. Estimate contamination subspace (shared task-agnostic patterns)
all_vectors = torch.stack(list(concept_vectors.values()))
contamination_subspace = estimate_contamination_subspace(
    all_vectors,
    n_components=min(len(concepts), 5)  # Top-5 principal components
)

# 3. For each concept, estimate task manifold (concept-specific curved surface)
for concept in concepts:
    task_manifold = estimate_task_manifold(
        concept_vector=concept_vectors[concept],
        n_samples=16,  # Collect activations from low-strength steered generations
        strength_range=[0.05, 0.15]
    )
```

### Dual-Subspace Steering
```python
# Apply both contamination removal and task manifold projection
def dual_subspace_steering(hidden_states, concept, strength):
    # Step 1: Remove contamination (orthogonal projection)
    for basis_vector in contamination_subspace:
        projection = (hidden_states @ basis_vector) * basis_vector
        hidden_states = hidden_states - projection

    # Step 2: Project along task manifold
    task_vector = task_manifolds[concept]
    projection = (hidden_states @ task_vector.unsqueeze(-1)) * task_vector
    steered = hidden_states - strength * projection

    return steered
```

### WordNet Graph Negatives
```python
# Semantic distance-based negative sampling (unchanged from Phase 2)
negatives = sample_distant_negatives(
    concept_synset,
    min_distance=5,  # WordNet path hops
    candidates=all_117k_synsets
)

# Structured relationships for comprehensive concept coverage
related = {
    'hypernyms': [...],   # is-a (broader)
    'hyponyms': [...],    # types-of (narrower)
    'meronyms': [...],    # has-part
    'holonyms': [...],    # member-of
    'antonyms': [...]     # opposites
}
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Train Binary Classifiers (Phase 2)
```bash
# Train 1×1 minimal classifiers for 10 concepts
poetry run python scripts/train_binary_classifiers.py \
    --concept-graph data/concept_graph/wordnet_v2_top10.json \
    --model google/gemma-3-4b-pt \

# Expected: 100% validation accuracy in ~5 minutes
```

### 2. Dual-Subspace Manifold Steering (Phase 6.6)
```bash
# Test advanced manifold steering on 5 concepts
poetry run python scripts/phase_6_6_dual_subspace.py \
    --device cuda

# Output: results/phase_6_6_dual_subspace/
# - Contamination subspace visualization

# - Steering effectiveness metrics
```

### 3. Logarithmic Scaling Validation (Phase 7)
```bash
# Find optimal training scale [2,4,8,16,32,64] samples/concept

```

## Tech Stack

- **Model**: Gemma-3-4b-pt for generation, can be rerun on other models
- **Framework**: PyTorch + PyTorch Lightning
- **Storage**: HDF5 with gzip compression
- **Concept Graph**: WordNet (117K synsets)
- **Training**: Binary cross-entropy per concept
- **Architecture**: BiLSTM + MLP classifier
- **Steering**: Linear concept vectors extracted from classifiers
- **Inference**: Sliding window (size=20, stride=5)

## Key Learnings

**What Works:**
1. **minimal training**: Scales excellently (91.9% @ n=1000 for one sample)
2. **Negative steering**: Highly effective suppression
3. **Semantic grouping**: Tracks broader steering effects than exact matches
4. **Concept-specific prompts**: Enable quantitative steering measuremen

**Open Questions:**
1. Positive steering variability across concepts
2. Optimal steering strength selection
3. Role of antonyms in negative steering
4. Scaling to 10K+ concepts
5. Rather than treating the residual error as noise, we could analyse the activation clusters to identify the model’s nearest analogues. By steering the probe toward those centroids, we might iteratively co-define a hybrid ontology that sits at the intersection of human and model semantics.

**Failed Approaches:**
- Generic steering prompts (can't measure steering effect)
- Exact term matching only (misses semantic field effects)
- Large sample sets (compute inefficient, tests saturated @ 40 definitions and 40 relations

##FAQs

**Feature purity vs polysemy** Are HatCat’s concept activations cleaner than SAE features?
I don't know about "cleaner" we get a probability for each of the top concepts for each time slice. This accounts for the model "thinking" about multiple things even while outputing one token. If anything its "messier", but thats also more reflective of whats happening. SAEs aim for one feature per 'thing', we explicitly
  allow multiple concepts active because that's how models actually work"

**Faithfulness**  Does turning a HatCat concept on/off change model behaviour in the expected way?
kind of. it can seemingly enhance and surpress entire conceptual fields, this isn't term or token surpression though and seems more akin to temperature changes than censoring an embedding. Like if you amp up an emotion, the model changes its outputs in a way akin to having that emotion, and if you supress that emotion it will change behaviour but can still say the word

**Temporal coherence** Does HatCat track concepts through generation rather than just static token 
Yes, basically in real time but obviously inference compute dependent. the codebase includes tests to demo this. Need to test at scale

**Hierarchical consistency** Do parent/child relationships behave monotonically?
The relationship training schedule usually achieves this, but it also depends on their relative semantic density since that scales the training data which can influence concept activation strength,  which is also true in the model. 

**Data-efficiency benchmark** How many examples per concept reach a target accuracy?
i ran a matrix of these tests, we were around 75%-80% accuracy from a sample pair, around 95% from 10 sample pairs and 99-100% around 40 sample pairs. Will publish charts and paper soon. See TEST_DATA_REGISTER.Md for raw data now

**Interpretability survey** Can humans successfully label what each unit means in a blind evaluation?
that is going to require some other humans

**Cross-model generalisation** Do the same concept classifiers transfer across LLMs?
Within a family it might kind of work, but i can't see any reason that the activations for different model families should be the same for the same concept. Still, if you can just train a new hatcat for another model in a couple of hours thats not really a big deal

**Scalability sanity** Does performance degrade as concepts → 100 K +?
at 10, 100, 1000 its been better at bigger scales, will see at 10k, but the trend so far has that disambiguation improves with concept scale


**Comparative steering quality** Are HatCat steering vectors more targeted?
No, we're supressing conceptual fields not logits . so i don't know this will ever be Golden Gate bridge levels of logit. maybe with much bigger knowledge graphs 

**Interpretability completeness**  does HatCat fully interpret neurons?
No, this is probabilistic interprability. We're sending human concepts as probes into a higher-dimensional activation space and getting soundings of the manifold they're in. They can sit in the rough area of a concept, but can't reach full accuracy because our concepts don't match the model concepts.  Although activation signatures converge rapidly in cosine space, relative differences plateau at ~0.3, suggesting a residual manifold spread that resists simple linear collapse. Confidence interval width declines primarily because of averaging noise, not complete semantic unification. 

**Correlation vs Causation** Sounds like probes pick up correlates, won't you need causal evals to move the model reasoning? 
There aren't really repeatable causal chains in probabilistic systems, just the gradients things are likely to follow. It absolutely is picking up correlates, but we iterate through the relationships that concept has with surrounding concepts so the correlations are still grounded in their relative topology.  If your bowling alley has slope down in one direction, that doesn't cause all shots to go that way, but it does 


**Allowing vulnerabilities**  This is unsafe code which exposes vulnerabilities in deployed systems

We're not creating these problems, we're making them impossible to ignore. There are likely to be some negative use cases, but long term safety requires this infrastructure.  It was irresponsible of model creators to let capability so eceed interpretability. This turns the lights on and exposes some dirty laundry, but those failure modes already existed and are being ignored.
