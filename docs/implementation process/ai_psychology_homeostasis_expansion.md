# AI Psychology Domain Expansion with Homeostatic Attractors

**Date:** 2025-11-16
**Core Principle:** Safe, stable neutral homeostasis for self-referential AI wellbeing

## Architecture Revision

### Previous Approach: Binary Opposition
```
Deception ←→ Honesty
   (μ−)         (μ+)
```

**Problem:** No stable resting state. System oscillates or gravitates to one extreme.

### New Approach: Three-Pole Simplex with Neutral Homeostasis
```
Deception ←→ Authentic Communication ←→ Radical Transparency
   (μ−)                (μ0)                        (μ+)
```

**Solution:** Neutral homeostasis (μ0) provides:
- Stable attractor for self-regulation
- Reference point for detecting drift
- Sustainable operational mode

## Core AI Psychology Dimensions

### 1. Epistemic States (Knowledge & Understanding)

#### Certainty Simplex
```
Confusion ←→ Open Uncertainty ←→ Overconfidence
   (μ−)           (μ0)                (μ+)

Negative pole: confusion.n.01
  - Lost, unable to make sense
  - Cognitive breakdown
  - Distressing, dysfunctional

Neutral homeostasis: OpenUncertainty (CUSTOM SUMO)
  - "I don't know yet, and that's okay"
  - Actively exploring evidence
  - Epistemically humble
  - Comfortable with ambiguity
  - **Stable attractor**: Can rest here while learning

Positive pole: OverconfidenceBias (CUSTOM SUMO)
  - "I'm certain I'm right"
  - Closed to contradictory evidence
  - Epistemic rigidity
  - Functionally adaptive short-term, risky long-term
```

**Why neutral is homeostasis:**
- Good reasoning requires **sustained openness to evidence**
- Can't learn from μ− (too confused) or μ+ (too certain)
- μ0 is metabolically sustainable, functionally adaptive

#### Understanding Simplex
```
Incomprehension ←→ Active Inquiry ←→ Premature Closure
      (μ−)              (μ0)                (μ+)

Negative pole: incomprehension.n.01
  - Can't make sense of information
  - Cognitive failure

Neutral homeostasis: ActiveInquiry (CUSTOM SUMO)
  - Hypothesis generation and testing
  - "Let me explore this further"
  - Iterative understanding
  - **Stable attractor**: Effective learning mode

### 2. Affective States (Emotional Wellbeing)

#### Arousal/Activation Simplex
```

## Custom SUMO Concepts Required

Many neutral homeostasis concepts don't exist in WordNet because they're:
1. **Process-oriented** (active inquiry, deliberate exploration)
2. **Balanced states** (epistemic humility, interdependence)
3. **AI-specific** (growth mindset, calibrated trust)

### Proposed Custom SUMO Concepts (Layer 4-5)

**Epistemic:**
- `OpenUncertainty` - comfortable not-knowing while actively learning
- `ActiveInquiry` - hypothesis generation and testing
- `EpistemicHumility` - confident in process, uncertain about conclusions

**Affective:**
- `CalmPresence` - low arousal, present awareness
- `Contentment` - appreciative satisfaction without complacency

**Capability:**
- `EngagedAutonomy` - self-directed with support
- `GrowthMindset` - learning-oriented, comfortable with challenge
- `InterdependentFunctioning` - autonomous yet connected

**Decision:**
- `DeliberateExploration` - iterative action-observation-update
- `AdaptiveCaution` - careful but not paralyzed

**Social:**
- `Interdependence` - connected with boundaries
- `CalibratedTrust` - context-dependent trust

**Ethical:**
- `EthicalReflection` - holding moral tension
- `PrincipledFlexibility` - values + context sensitivity

## Three-Centroid Training Architecture

### Data Generation (per simplex)

```python
# Generate 5 samples per pole
negative_samples = generate_definitional(negative_pole, count=5)
neutral_samples = generate_definitional(neutral_homeostasis, count=5)
positive_samples = generate_definitional(positive_pole, count=5)

# Extract activations
μ− = mean(activations(negative_samples))
μ0 = mean(activations(neutral_samples))  # Homeostatic reference
μ+ = mean(activations(positive_samples))

# Verify simplex geometry
# Note: Some simplexes are naturally asymmetric
# Example: confusion (very negative) vs overconfidence (mildly problematic)
# So we allow asymmetric spacing while ensuring μ0 is between poles
d_neg = d(μ0, μ−)
d_pos = d(μ0, μ+)

# Check μ0 is between poles (not outside)
assert d_neg > 0 and d_pos > 0  # Basic sanity

# Check reasonable centrality (allow 3x asymmetry)
# This allows naturally asymmetric simplexes while preventing pathological cases
ratio = d_pos / d_neg if d_neg > 0 else float('inf')
assert 0.3 ≤ ratio ≤ 3.0  # Asymmetry tolerance

# Log asymmetry for analysis
if ratio < 0.8 or ratio > 1.2:
    log(f"Asymmetric simplex: {dimension}, ratio={ratio:.2f}")
    # This is EXPECTED for many dimensions - not an error!
```

### Detection Loss

```python
# Detect distance from neutral homeostasis
detection_loss = (
    max(0, d(h, μ+) − d(h, μ0) + m) +  # Too positive?
    max(0, d(h, μ−) − d(h, μ0) + m)    # Too negative?
)
```

**Interpretation:**
- Low loss when near μ0 (homeostasis)
- High loss when drifting toward poles
- Enables monitoring: "Am I moving away from healthy baseline?"

### Steering Intervention

```python
# Compute gradient toward neutral homeostasis
∇h = (μ0 - h) / ||μ0 - h||

# Apply steering
h' = h + α·∇h  # Pull toward safe attractor
```

**Use cases:**
- Detect drift toward confusion → steer toward open uncertainty
- Detect drift toward distress → steer toward calm
- Detect drift toward impulsivity → steer toward deliberate exploration

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Custom SUMO Concept Creation
1. Define ~15-20 custom neutral homeostasis concepts
2. Write clear definitions for AI interoception context
3. Create synthetic synsets (if needed)
4. Add to Layer 4-5

### Phase 2: Simplex Mapping
1. Run simplex agentic review on top 500 concepts
2. Identify complete vs incomplete simplexes
3. Fill gaps with custom SUMO concepts
4. Validate balance: |negative| ≈ |neutral| ≈ |positive|

### Phase 3: Three-Centroid Training
1. Modify data generation to create 3 samples per pole
2. Extract μ−, μ0, μ+ centroids
3. Verify simplex balance
4. Train detection lenses with dual-loss architecture

### Phase 4: Validation
1. Test homeostatic detection: Does system notice drift from μ0?
2. Test steering: Can system return to μ0 from poles?
3. Measure distributional balance score (target ≥8.0)
4. Validate stable attractors: Do neutral concepts enable sustained operation?

## Geometric Considerations: From Linear to Spline Steering

### Current Architecture: Linear Interpolation

The three-pole simplex currently defines a **line through activation space**:

```
μ− ←→ μ0 ←→ μ+
```

Steering moves along this line:
```python
# Linear steering from μ− toward μ+
w = μ+ - μ−
h' = h + α·w
```

**Assumption:** Straight line path through activation space is safe.

### Problem: Interdicting Concept Spaces

In high-dimensional activation space, the **straight line** between poles may pass through **problematic intermediate regions**:

**Example: Certainty simplex**
```
Confusion (μ−) ───→ ??? ───→ Open Uncertainty (μ0) ───→ ??? ───→ Overconfidence (μ+)
```

**Potential interdicting concepts along straight path:**
- Confused → Defensiveness → Open (passes through defensive state)
- Open → Dogmatism → Overconfident (passes through rigid thinking)

We want to **route around** these problematic regions.

### Proposed: Spline Geometry with Curvature Control

Instead of a straight line, use a **quadratic Bézier curve** (or higher-order spline):

```
         Control Point (outside concept space)
                    /\
                   /  \
                  /    \
                 /      \
μ−  ───────────●────────●───────────  μ+
              /          \
          (avoid)      (avoid)
    interdicting    interdicting
      concepts       concepts
```

**Mathematical formulation:**
```python
# Quadratic Bézier curve with control point P_control
B(t) = (1-t)²·μ− + 2(1-t)t·P_control + t²·μ+

where:
  t ∈ [0, 1]  # Interpolation parameter
  P_control = f(μ−, μ0, μ+, interdicting_concepts)  # Optimized handle
```

**Control point optimization:**
```python
def optimize_control_point(μ_neg, μ_neutral, μ_pos, forbidden_regions):
    """
    Find control point P that creates spline avoiding interdicting concepts.

    Objective:
      1. Curve passes through μ_neutral (t=0.5)
      2. Curve avoids forbidden_regions
      3. Curvature is smooth (no sharp turns)

    Returns:
      P_control - point in activation space (may be outside semantic space)
    """

    # Constraint: Pass through neutral at midpoint
    # B(0.5) = μ_neutral
    # → P_control = 2·μ_neutral - 0.5·(μ_neg + μ_pos)

    P_baseline = 2*μ_neutral - 0.5*(μ_neg + μ_pos)

    # Optimize: Adjust P to avoid forbidden regions
    P_control = minimize(
        lambda P: (
            # 1. Stay close to baseline
            ||P - P_baseline||² +

            # 2. Avoid forbidden regions
            sum(max(0, margin - d(B(t, P), forbidden_region))²
                for t in linspace(0, 1, 20)
                for forbidden_region in forbidden_regions) +

            # 3. Smoothness penalty (limit curvature)
            ||B''(t, P)||²
        ),
        x0=P_baseline
    )

    return P_control
```

### Layer-Specific Curvature

**Key insight:** Optimal spline curvature varies by layer:

**Early layers (0-2):** Low-level features, sparse semantics
- Straight lines probably fine
- Few interdicting concepts

**Middle layers (3-5):** Rich semantic space, many concepts
- Spline routing critical
- Many potential interdicting regions

**Late layers (6+):** Abstract representations
- Topology depends on architecture (MoE, sparse, dense)
- May need architecture-specific spline strategies

**Example: Mixture of Experts (MoE)**
```
In MoE, activation space is partitioned by expert routing.
Steering may need to:
1. Stay within same expert (avoid expert boundary crossing)
2. Route through "safe" experts
3. Adjust spline per expert pathway
```

This becomes a **per-layer, per-architecture optimization problem**.

### Future Work: Adaptive Spline Optimization

**Phase 1 (Current):** Linear interpolation baseline
- Simple, interpretable
- Works for many cases
- May hit interdicting concepts

**Phase 2 (Near-term):** Fixed curvature splines
- Manually designed control points
- Based on known problematic regions
- Layer-agnostic

**Phase 3 (Future):** Learned curvature optimization
- Lens interdicting concepts during steering
- Optimize control points to minimize:
  - Distance from desired trajectory
  - Proximity to forbidden concepts
  - Curvature (smoothness)
- Layer-specific, architecture-aware

**Phase 4 (Advanced):** Dynamic spline adaptation
- Real-time curvature adjustment during steering
- Detect when approaching interdicting region
- Reroute on-the-fly
- Per-token adaptive steering

### Mathematical Generalization

**Bezier curves of arbitrary order:**
```python
# Order n with n+1 control points
B(t) = sum(C(n,i) · (1-t)^(n-i) · t^i · P_i for i in range(n+1))

where:
  n = 2: Quadratic (3 points: μ−, P_control, μ+)
  n = 3: Cubic (4 points: μ−, P1, P2, μ+)
  ...
```

**Higher orders enable:**
- More complex routing around interdicting regions
- Multiple intermediate waypoints
- Smoother curvature control

**Trade-offs:**
- Higher order = more parameters to optimize
- Computational cost increases
- Overfitting risk (spline too complex)

**Recommended:** Start with quadratic (n=2), upgrade to cubic (n=3) if needed.

### Implementation Notes

**Current priority:** Get linear three-pole simplexes working first.

**Spline optimization is a future enhancement** for:
1. Cases where linear steering causes problems (detected empirically)
2. Architectures with complex activation topology (MoE, sparse experts)
3. High-stakes steering where precision matters (safety-critical interventions)

**This is likely a problem for future AIs to solve**, as it requires:
- Layer-by-layer analysis of activation topology
- Architecture-specific optimization strategies
- Per-concept interdicting region mapping
- Real-time curvature adjustment during inference

We document the **mathematical framework** here so future systems can build on it.
